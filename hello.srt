1
00:01:21,915 --> 00:01:26,960
I should've known that you would
be here, Professor McGonagall.

2
00:01:38,180 --> 00:01:41,350
Good evening, Professor Dumbledore.

3
00:01:43,855 --> 00:01:46,855
Are the rumors true, Albus?

4
00:01:47,065 --> 00:01:52,320
I'm afraid so, professor.
The good and the bad.

5
00:01:52,530 --> 00:01:55,780
- And the boy?
- Hagrid is bringing him.

6
00:01:55,990 --> 00:01:59,910
Is it wise to trust Hagrid
with something so important?

7
00:02:00,410 --> 00:02:05,375
Professor, I would trust Hagrid
with my life.

8
00:02:24,185 --> 00:02:28,315
Professor Dumbledore, sir.
Professor McGonagall.

9
00:02:28,525 --> 00:02:32,400
- No problems, I trust, Hagrid?
- No, sir.

10
00:02:32,610 --> 00:02:37,075
Little tyke fell asleep
as we were flying over Bristol.

11
00:02:37,910 --> 00:02:40,370
Try not to wake him.

12
00:02:41,120 --> 00:02:43,205
There you go.

13
00:02:48,630 --> 00:02:53,215
Do you really think it's safe,
leaving him with these people?

14
00:02:53,425 --> 00:02:58,680
I've watched them all day.
They're the worst sort of Muggles.

15
00:02:58,885 --> 00:03:02,890
- They really are--
- The only family he has.

16
00:03:03,100 --> 00:03:08,065
He'll be famous. Every child
in our world will know his name.

17
00:03:08,271 --> 00:03:10,023
Exactly.

18
00:03:10,232 --> 00:03:14,486
He's far better off growing up
away from all of that.

19
00:03:16,988 --> 00:03:19,699
Until he's ready.

20
00:03:31,795 --> 00:03:37,217
There, there, Hagrid.
It's not really goodbye, after all.

21
00:03:48,979 --> 00:03:50,605
Good luck...

22
00:03:51,273 --> 00:03:53,775
...Harry Potter.

23
00:04:11,334 --> 00:04:14,337
Up. Get up!

24
00:04:16,965 --> 00:04:18,466
Now!

25
00:04:32,188 --> 00:04:35,525
Wake up, cousin!
We're going to the zoo!

26
00:04:46,703 --> 00:04:52,000
- Here he comes, the birthday boy.
- Happy birthday, son.

27
00:04:53,877 --> 00:04:57,005
Cook breakfast.
And try not to burn anything.

28
00:04:57,213 --> 00:05:02,135
- Yes, Aunt Petunia.
- I want everything to be perfect...

29
00:05:02,385 --> 00:05:05,346
...for my Dudley's special day!

30
00:05:05,555 --> 00:05:10,477
- Hurry up! Bring my coffee, boy.
- Yes, Uncle Vernon.

31
00:05:11,686 --> 00:05:14,856
Aren't they wonderful, darling?

32
00:05:16,983 --> 00:05:20,487
- How many are there?
- 36. Counted them myself.

33
00:05:20,737 --> 00:05:23,907
36?! But last year I had 37!

34
00:05:24,115 --> 00:05:28,036
- But some are bigger than last year's.
- I don't care!

35
00:05:28,203 --> 00:05:30,747
This is what we're going to do.

36
00:05:30,955 --> 00:05:35,293
We're going to buy you two
new presents. How's that, pumpkin?

37
00:05:37,295 --> 00:05:42,842
It should be a lovely day at the zoo.
I'm really looking forward to it.

38
00:05:46,221 --> 00:05:48,056
I'm warning you now, boy.

39
00:05:48,431 --> 00:05:51,935
Any funny business, any at all...

40
00:05:52,143 --> 00:05:55,230
...and you won't have
any meals for a week.

41
00:05:55,813 --> 00:05:57,524
Get in.

42
00:06:04,739 --> 00:06:07,116
Make it move.

43
00:06:09,827 --> 00:06:11,538
Move!

44
00:06:11,746 --> 00:06:14,207
- Move!
- He's asleep!

45
00:06:14,457 --> 00:06:16,960
He's boring.

46
00:06:19,420 --> 00:06:20,880
Sorry about him.

47
00:06:21,089 --> 00:06:24,801
He doesn't understand
what it's like, lying there...

48
00:06:25,343 --> 00:06:29,180
...watching people press
their ugly faces in on you.

49
00:06:31,933 --> 00:06:34,602
Can you hear me?

50
00:06:37,063 --> 00:06:41,109
It's just, I've never talked
to a snake before.

51
00:06:41,609 --> 00:06:43,027
Do you...?

52
00:06:43,236 --> 00:06:47,323
Do you talk to people often?

53
00:06:48,449 --> 00:06:51,786
You're from Burma, aren't you?
Was it nice there?

54
00:06:51,995 --> 00:06:54,289
Do you miss your family?

55
00:06:57,125 --> 00:07:01,879
I see. That's me as well.
I never knew my parents either.

56
00:07:02,088 --> 00:07:07,051
Mummy, Dad, you won't believe
what this snake is doing!

57
00:07:30,158 --> 00:07:32,160
Thanks.

58
00:07:32,368 --> 00:07:33,828
Anytime.

59
00:07:37,165 --> 00:07:39,083
Snake!

60
00:07:54,515 --> 00:07:57,894
Mum! Mummy! Help me!

61
00:07:58,102 --> 00:08:01,230
My darling boy!
How did you get in there?

62
00:08:01,773 --> 00:08:06,861
Who did this? How did you get
in there? Is there a snake?

63
00:08:11,699 --> 00:08:16,996
It's all right, sweetheart.
We'll get you out of these cold clothes.

64
00:08:18,790 --> 00:08:21,709
- What happened?
- I swear, I don't know!

65
00:08:21,918 --> 00:08:25,797
The glass was there
and then it was gone, like magic.

66
00:08:30,218 --> 00:08:33,095
There's no such thing as magic.

67
00:09:09,799 --> 00:09:12,426
Marge is ill. Ate a funny whelk.

68
00:09:12,635 --> 00:09:15,930
- Dad, look! Harry's got a letter!
- It's mine!

69
00:09:16,097 --> 00:09:18,849
Yours? Who'd be writing to you?

70
00:09:50,131 --> 00:09:54,677
No more mail through this letterbox.

71
00:10:06,856 --> 00:10:09,608
Have a lovely day at the office, dear.

72
00:10:12,570 --> 00:10:15,239
Shoo! Go on.

73
00:10:40,097 --> 00:10:42,933
Fine day, Sunday.

74
00:10:43,601 --> 00:10:48,272
In my opinion, best day of the week.
Why is that, Dudley?

75
00:10:48,481 --> 00:10:52,902
- Because there's no post on Sundays?
- Right you are, Harry!

76
00:10:53,110 --> 00:10:55,821
No post on Sunday.

77
00:10:57,281 --> 00:11:01,202
No blasted letters today! No, sir.

78
00:11:01,744 --> 00:11:06,749
Not one single bloody letter. Not one!

79
00:11:15,091 --> 00:11:19,053
No, sir, not one blasted, miserable--

80
00:11:30,564 --> 00:11:32,775
Make it stop, please!

81
00:11:34,568 --> 00:11:36,487
Stop it!

82
00:11:40,574 --> 00:11:43,536
Mummy, what's happening?

83
00:11:46,997 --> 00:11:51,335
Give me that! Give me that letter!

84
00:11:53,921 --> 00:11:55,714
Get off!

85
00:11:59,426 --> 00:12:03,639
They're my letters! Let go of me!

86
00:12:04,431 --> 00:12:07,434
That's it! We're going away!

87
00:12:08,143 --> 00:12:11,814
Far away, where they can't find us!

88
00:12:12,022 --> 00:12:15,276
Daddy's gone mad, hasn't he?

89
00:12:50,144 --> 00:12:52,479
Make a wish, Harry.

90
00:13:08,579 --> 00:13:10,623
Who's there?

91
00:13:22,760 --> 00:13:25,220
Sorry about that.

92
00:13:32,061 --> 00:13:36,690
I demand that you leave at once.
You are breaking and entering.

93
00:13:39,526 --> 00:13:42,404
Dry up, Dursley, you great prune.

94
00:13:47,618 --> 00:13:51,121
I haven't seen you
since you was a baby, Harry.

95
00:13:51,330 --> 00:13:55,834
You're a bit more along than I expected.
Particularly in the middle.

96
00:13:56,043 --> 00:13:58,879
I'm not Harry.

97
00:14:00,756 --> 00:14:04,468
- I am.
- Well, of course you are.

98
00:14:05,219 --> 00:14:06,845
Got something for you.

99
00:14:07,054 --> 00:14:12,601
Afraid I sat on it, but I imagine
it'll taste fine just the same.

100
00:14:15,145 --> 00:14:18,565
Baked it myself, words and all.

101
00:14:24,071 --> 00:14:25,114
Thank you.

102
00:14:25,405 --> 00:14:29,493
It's not every day your young man
turns 11, is it?

103
00:14:44,716 --> 00:14:48,846
Excuse me, but who are you?

104
00:14:49,054 --> 00:14:53,976
Rubeus Hagrid, Keeper of Keys
and Grounds at Hogwarts.

105
00:14:54,184 --> 00:14:57,896
- Of course, you know about Hogwarts.
- Sorry, no.

106
00:14:58,522 --> 00:15:03,443
Didn't you ever wonder where
your mum and dad learned it all?

107
00:15:03,652 --> 00:15:05,070
Learned what?

108
00:15:05,279 --> 00:15:07,739
You're a wizard, Harry.

109
00:15:08,991 --> 00:15:11,076
- I'm a what?
- A wizard.

110
00:15:11,285 --> 00:15:14,329
A good one, I'd wager,
once you're trained up.

111
00:15:14,538 --> 00:15:17,499
No, you've made a mistake.
I mean...

112
00:15:17,624 --> 00:15:20,627
...I can't be a wizard.

113
00:15:21,253 --> 00:15:26,049
I mean, I'm just Harry. Just Harry.

114
00:15:27,134 --> 00:15:31,138
Well, Just Harry, did you ever
make anything happen?

115
00:15:31,346 --> 00:15:35,934
Anything you couldn't explain,
when you were angry or scared?

116
00:15:52,409 --> 00:15:55,537
"Dear Mr. Potter,
We are pleased to accept you...

117
00:15:55,746 --> 00:15:58,957
...at Hogwarts School
of Witchcraft and Wizardry."

118
00:15:59,166 --> 00:16:04,129
He will not be going! We swore
we'd put a stop to all this rubbish.

119
00:16:04,338 --> 00:16:08,592
You knew? You knew all along
and you never told me?

120
00:16:08,800 --> 00:16:11,887
Of course we knew.
How could you not be?

121
00:16:12,095 --> 00:16:15,807
My perfect sister being who she was.

122
00:16:16,016 --> 00:16:21,980
My mother and father were so proud
the day she got her letter.

123
00:16:22,189 --> 00:16:26,318
"We have a witch in the family.
Isn't it wonderful?"

124
00:16:26,526 --> 00:16:30,197
I was the only one to see her
for what she was.

125
00:16:30,405 --> 00:16:32,157
A freak!

126
00:16:32,366 --> 00:16:35,994
Then she met that Potter,
and then she had you...

127
00:16:36,203 --> 00:16:41,291
...and I knew you would be the same.
Just as strange, just as abnormal.

128
00:16:41,500 --> 00:16:46,505
And then she got herself blown up,
and we got landed with you.

129
00:16:46,713 --> 00:16:50,717
Blown up? You told me
my parents died in a car crash.

130
00:16:50,926 --> 00:16:55,263
A car crash? A car crash killed
Lily and James Potter?

131
00:16:55,472 --> 00:16:59,351
- We had to say something.
- It's an outrage! A scandal!

132
00:16:59,518 --> 00:17:02,062
He'll not be going.

133
00:17:02,270 --> 00:17:05,565
A great Muggle like you
is going to stop him?

134
00:17:05,774 --> 00:17:06,775
Muggle?

135
00:17:07,109 --> 00:17:11,154
Non-magic folk. This boy's had
his name down since he were born.

136
00:17:11,363 --> 00:17:15,242
He's going to the finest school
of witchcraft and wizardry.

137
00:17:15,450 --> 00:17:21,331
He'll be under the finest headmaster
Hogwarts has seen, Albus Dumbledore.

138
00:17:21,540 --> 00:17:26,378
I will not pay to have a crackpot
old fool teach him magic tricks.

139
00:17:26,586 --> 00:17:31,133
Never insult Albus Dumbledore...

140
00:17:31,341 --> 00:17:33,343
...in front of me.

141
00:17:51,278 --> 00:17:56,533
I'd appreciate it if you didn't tell
anyone at Hogwarts about that.

142
00:17:56,741 --> 00:18:00,829
- I'm not allowed to do magic.
- Okay.

143
00:18:02,164 --> 00:18:05,083
We're a bit behind schedule.
Best be off.

144
00:18:11,298 --> 00:18:14,551
Unless you'd rather stay, of course.

145
00:18:28,857 --> 00:18:32,110
"All students must be equipped with...

146
00:18:32,277 --> 00:18:35,280
...one standard size 2
pewter cauldron...

147
00:18:35,488 --> 00:18:41,286
...and may bring, if they desire,
either an owl, a cat or a toad."

148
00:18:41,494 --> 00:18:44,122
Can we find all this in London?

149
00:18:44,331 --> 00:18:46,666
If you know where to go.

150
00:19:09,481 --> 00:19:12,442
Ah, Hagrid! The usual, I presume?

151
00:19:12,651 --> 00:19:16,529
No, thanks, Tom.
I'm on official Hogwarts business.

152
00:19:16,738 --> 00:19:19,783
Just helping Harry
buy his school supplies.

153
00:19:19,991 --> 00:19:23,620
Bless my soul.
It's Harry Potter!

154
00:19:27,832 --> 00:19:31,336
Welcome back, Mr. Potter.
Welcome back.

155
00:19:31,544 --> 00:19:35,840
Doris Crockford. I can't believe
I'm meeting you at last.

156
00:19:36,383 --> 00:19:41,638
Harry Potter. Can't tell you
how pleased I am to meet you.

157
00:19:41,846 --> 00:19:44,307
Hello, professor. I didn't see you.

158
00:19:44,516 --> 00:19:49,604
Professor Quirrell will be your
Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher.

159
00:19:49,813 --> 00:19:52,232
Oh, nice to meet you.

160
00:19:52,440 --> 00:19:55,527
Fearfully fascinating subject.

161
00:19:55,735 --> 00:20:00,365
Not that you need it, eh, Potter?

162
00:20:01,324 --> 00:20:05,495
Yes, well, must be going now.
Lots to buy.

163
00:20:05,704 --> 00:20:07,455
Goodbye.

164
00:20:10,125 --> 00:20:13,753
- See, Harry? You're famous.
- But why am I famous?

165
00:20:13,962 --> 00:20:17,382
All those people,
how is it they know who I am?

166
00:20:17,590 --> 00:20:21,428
I'm not sure I'm the right person
to tell you that.

167
00:20:38,403 --> 00:20:42,198
Welcome, Harry, to Diagon Alley.

168
00:20:58,506 --> 00:21:01,050
Here, you get your quills and ink.

169
00:21:01,259 --> 00:21:05,221
Over there, all your bits and bobs
for doing wizardry.

170
00:21:30,079 --> 00:21:32,290
It's a world-class racing broom.

171
00:21:32,498 --> 00:21:36,419
Look at it! The new Nimbus 2000!

172
00:21:36,628 --> 00:21:39,923
It's the fastest model yet.

173
00:21:43,551 --> 00:21:48,223
But how am I to pay for all this?
I haven't any money.

174
00:21:48,431 --> 00:21:51,893
There's your money.
Gringotts, the wizard bank.

175
00:21:52,060 --> 00:21:57,482
Ain't no safer place, not one.
Except perhaps Hogwarts.

176
00:22:10,203 --> 00:22:14,165
Hagrid, what exactly
are these things?

177
00:22:14,374 --> 00:22:19,671
They're goblins. Clever as they come,
but not the most friendly of beasts.

178
00:22:19,879 --> 00:22:21,798
Best stay close.

179
00:22:25,843 --> 00:22:29,514
Mr. Harry Potter wishes
to make a withdrawal.

180
00:22:33,768 --> 00:22:36,938
And does Mr. Harry Potter
have his key?

181
00:22:37,855 --> 00:22:41,109
Wait a minute.
Got it here somewhere.

182
00:22:43,945 --> 00:22:46,781
Ha! There's the little devil.

183
00:22:46,990 --> 00:22:49,826
And there's something else as well.

184
00:22:51,119 --> 00:22:54,455
Professor Dumbledore gave me this.

185
00:22:58,501 --> 00:23:03,548
It's about You-Know-What
in vault you-know-which.

186
00:23:04,882 --> 00:23:06,843
Very well.

187
00:23:12,014 --> 00:23:14,892
Vault 687.

188
00:23:16,769 --> 00:23:19,063
Lamp, please.

189
00:23:27,572 --> 00:23:28,948
Key, please.

190
00:23:52,388 --> 00:23:56,392
Did you think your parents
would leave you with nothing?

191
00:23:57,393 --> 00:24:01,147
- Vault 713.
- What's in there, Hagrid?

192
00:24:01,355 --> 00:24:05,526
Can't tell you.
Hogwarts business. Very secret.

193
00:24:05,735 --> 00:24:07,278
Stand back.

194
00:24:35,598 --> 00:24:38,392
Best not to mention this to anyone.

195
00:24:46,776 --> 00:24:50,738
I still need a wand.

196
00:24:50,947 --> 00:24:55,117
A wand? You want Ollivanders.
There ain't no place better.

197
00:24:55,284 --> 00:25:00,122
Run along there and wait. I got one more
thing to do. Won't be long.

198
00:25:18,140 --> 00:25:19,976
Hello?

199
00:25:22,937 --> 00:25:24,814
Hello?

200
00:25:28,317 --> 00:25:32,613
I wondered when
I'd be seeing you, Mr. Potter.

201
00:25:40,371 --> 00:25:42,623
It seems only yesterday...

202
00:25:42,832 --> 00:25:48,713
...that your mother and father were
in here buying their first wands.

203
00:25:55,344 --> 00:25:57,638
Here we are.

204
00:26:06,230 --> 00:26:08,774
Give it a wave.

205
00:26:15,239 --> 00:26:17,825
Apparently not.

206
00:26:25,249 --> 00:26:27,460
Perhaps...

207
00:26:29,128 --> 00:26:31,297
...this.

208
00:26:38,262 --> 00:26:42,933
No, no, definitely not.
No matter.

209
00:26:50,191 --> 00:26:51,776
I wonder....

210
00:27:21,096 --> 00:27:23,390
Curious.

211
00:27:23,599 --> 00:27:26,519
Very curious.

212
00:27:26,727 --> 00:27:29,855
Sorry, but what's curious?

213
00:27:31,482 --> 00:27:34,860
I remember every wand
I've ever sold, Mr. Potter.

214
00:27:35,069 --> 00:27:37,780
It so happens that the phoenix...

215
00:27:37,988 --> 00:27:42,660
...whose tail feather resides
in your wand, gave another feather.

216
00:27:43,160 --> 00:27:46,247
Just one other.

217
00:27:46,455 --> 00:27:50,793
It is curious that you should
be destined for this wand...

218
00:27:51,001 --> 00:27:56,715
...when its brother
gave you that scar.

219
00:27:58,509 --> 00:28:01,720
And who owned that wand?

220
00:28:02,596 --> 00:28:04,974
We do not speak his name.

221
00:28:05,474 --> 00:28:08,936
The wand chooses
the wizard, Mr. Potter.

222
00:28:09,186 --> 00:28:12,147
It's not always clear why.

223
00:28:12,523 --> 00:28:15,985
But I think it is clear...

224
00:28:16,193 --> 00:28:20,155
...that we can expect
great things from you.

225
00:28:20,364 --> 00:28:24,660
After all, He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named...

226
00:28:24,868 --> 00:28:27,496
...did great things.

227
00:28:27,705 --> 00:28:29,665
Terrible...

228
00:28:30,207 --> 00:28:33,460
...yes, but great.

229
00:28:39,049 --> 00:28:41,051
Harry! Harry!

230
00:28:41,510 --> 00:28:43,846
Happy birthday.

231
00:28:51,020 --> 00:28:54,481
You all right, Harry?
You seem very quiet.

232
00:28:54,857 --> 00:29:00,487
He killed my parents, didn't he?
The one who gave me this.

233
00:29:00,696 --> 00:29:04,241
You know, Hagrid. I know you do.

234
00:29:08,162 --> 00:29:12,750
First, and understand this
because it's very important:

235
00:29:12,958 --> 00:29:15,461
Not all wizards are good.

236
00:29:15,669 --> 00:29:18,172
Some of them go bad.
A few years ago...

237
00:29:18,422 --> 00:29:23,385
...there was a wizard who went as bad
as you can go. His name was V--

238
00:29:23,594 --> 00:29:27,264
- His name was V--
- Maybe if you wrote it down?

239
00:29:27,473 --> 00:29:29,349
No, I can't spell it.

240
00:29:29,558 --> 00:29:33,771
- All right, Voldemort.
- Voldemort?

241
00:29:37,733 --> 00:29:40,027
It was dark times, Harry.

242
00:29:42,321 --> 00:29:45,407
Voldemort started
to gather some followers.

243
00:29:45,616 --> 00:29:48,994
Brought them over to the Dark Side.

244
00:29:50,412 --> 00:29:53,540
Anyone that stood up to him
ended up dead.

245
00:29:54,625 --> 00:29:57,711
Your parents fought against him.

246
00:29:57,920 --> 00:30:01,632
But nobody lived once
he decided to kill them.

247
00:30:06,094 --> 00:30:08,597
Nobody, not one.

248
00:30:08,806 --> 00:30:11,225
Except you.

249
00:30:13,268 --> 00:30:17,397
Me? Voldemort tried to kill me?

250
00:30:17,815 --> 00:30:22,027
Yes. That ain't no ordinary cut
on your forehead, Harry.

251
00:30:22,277 --> 00:30:28,075
A mark like that only comes from being
touched by a curse, an evil curse.

252
00:30:28,283 --> 00:30:31,828
What happened to V--?
To You-Know-Who?

253
00:30:32,996 --> 00:30:36,416
Well, some say he died.

254
00:30:36,625 --> 00:30:38,961
Codswallop, in my opinion.

255
00:30:39,169 --> 00:30:42,464
Nope, I reckon he's out there still...

256
00:30:42,673 --> 00:30:45,634
...too tired to carry on.

257
00:30:45,842 --> 00:30:51,306
But one thing's certain. Something
about you stumped him that night.

258
00:30:51,473 --> 00:30:55,769
That's why you're famous.
That's why everybody knows your name.

259
00:30:56,270 --> 00:30:59,898
You're the boy who lived.

260
00:31:09,199 --> 00:31:11,994
What are you looking at?

261
00:31:13,745 --> 00:31:15,664
Blimey, is that the time?

262
00:31:15,872 --> 00:31:19,960
I'm gonna have to leave you.
Dumbledore will be wanting his--

263
00:31:20,168 --> 00:31:25,007
Well, he'll be wanting to see me.
Your train leaves in 10 minutes.

264
00:31:25,173 --> 00:31:30,554
Here's your ticket. Stick to your ticket,
that's very important.

265
00:31:33,473 --> 00:31:35,726
"Platform 9 3/4"?

266
00:31:35,934 --> 00:31:40,731
But, Hagrid, there must be a mistake.
This says platform 9 3/4.

267
00:31:40,939 --> 00:31:44,276
There's no such thing, is there?

268
00:32:02,753 --> 00:32:04,338
Sorry.

269
00:32:05,839 --> 00:32:08,592
Excuse me. Excuse me.

270
00:32:08,800 --> 00:32:10,343
On your left.

271
00:32:10,552 --> 00:32:14,389
Can you tell me where
I might find platform 9 3/4?

272
00:32:14,598 --> 00:32:17,184
Think you're being funny, do you?

273
00:32:17,392 --> 00:32:20,729
It's the same every year,
packed with Muggles.

274
00:32:21,104 --> 00:32:24,524
- Muggles?
- Platform 9 3/4, this way.

275
00:32:30,238 --> 00:32:33,408
All right, Percy, you first.

276
00:32:43,335 --> 00:32:44,586
Fred, you next.

277
00:32:44,753 --> 00:32:48,423
- He's not Fred, I am.
- You call yourself our mother?

278
00:32:48,632 --> 00:32:50,592
I'm sorry, George.

279
00:32:54,763 --> 00:32:57,224
I'm only joking. I am Fred.

280
00:33:02,979 --> 00:33:05,565
Excuse me.

281
00:33:06,650 --> 00:33:09,486
Could you tell me how to...?

282
00:33:09,694 --> 00:33:13,240
How to get onto the platform?
Not to worry, dear.

283
00:33:13,448 --> 00:33:15,909
It's Ron's first time
to Hogwarts as well.

284
00:33:16,117 --> 00:33:21,998
All you do is walk straight at the wall
between platforms 9 and 10.

285
00:33:22,165 --> 00:33:25,627
- Best to run if you're nervous.
- Good luck.

286
00:34:23,226 --> 00:34:27,564
Excuse me. Do you mind?
Everywhere else is full.

287
00:34:27,731 --> 00:34:29,983
Not at all.

288
00:34:33,028 --> 00:34:35,488
I'm Ron, by the way.
Ron Weasley.

289
00:34:35,697 --> 00:34:38,325
I'm Harry. Harry Potter.

290
00:34:39,701 --> 00:34:41,745
So it's true!

291
00:34:41,953 --> 00:34:44,748
I mean, do you really have the...?

292
00:34:45,332 --> 00:34:48,209
- The what?
- The scar?

293
00:34:51,379 --> 00:34:53,590
Wicked!

294
00:34:56,051 --> 00:35:01,222
- Anything off the trolley, dears?
- No, thanks. I'm all set.

295
00:35:05,268 --> 00:35:07,562
We'll take the lot.

296
00:35:18,239 --> 00:35:23,078
- Bertie Bott's Every Flavor Beans?
- They mean every flavor.

297
00:35:23,453 --> 00:35:26,915
There's chocolate
and peppermint and also...

298
00:35:27,082 --> 00:35:30,960
...spinach, liver and tripe.

299
00:35:31,169 --> 00:35:35,256
George sweared he got
a booger-flavored one once.

300
00:35:40,595 --> 00:35:45,308
- Are they real frogs?
- It's a spell. You want the cards.

301
00:35:45,517 --> 00:35:50,980
Each pack's got a famous witch
or wizard. I've got about 500 meself.

302
00:35:52,524 --> 00:35:54,734
Watch it!

303
00:35:56,778 --> 00:36:00,615
That's rotten luck. They've only
got one good jump in them.

304
00:36:03,451 --> 00:36:07,330
- I've got Dumbledore!
- I got about six of him.

305
00:36:09,124 --> 00:36:10,667
Hey, he's gone!

306
00:36:10,875 --> 00:36:14,337
You can't expect him to
hang around all day, can you?

307
00:36:14,963 --> 00:36:18,091
This is Scabbers.
Pathetic, isn't he?

308
00:36:18,299 --> 00:36:19,467
A little.

309
00:36:19,676 --> 00:36:23,054
Fred gave me a spell
to turn him yellow. Want to see?

310
00:36:23,263 --> 00:36:25,265
Yeah.

311
00:36:32,021 --> 00:36:33,648
Has anyone seen a toad?

312
00:36:34,065 --> 00:36:36,651
- A boy named Neville's lost one.
- No.

313
00:36:37,318 --> 00:36:41,614
Oh, are you doing magic?
Let's see, then.

314
00:36:42,657 --> 00:36:46,995
Sunshine, daisies, butter mellow

315
00:36:47,287 --> 00:36:50,331
Turn this stupid, fat rat yellow

316
00:36:53,126 --> 00:36:58,673
Are you sure that's a real spell?
Well, it's not very good, is it?

317
00:36:58,882 --> 00:37:02,176
I've only tried
a few simple ones myself...

318
00:37:02,385 --> 00:37:05,013
...but they've all worked for me.

319
00:37:08,683 --> 00:37:10,685
For example:

320
00:37:11,102 --> 00:37:13,855
Oculus Reparo.

321
00:37:15,982 --> 00:37:18,568
That's better, isn't it?

322
00:37:19,777 --> 00:37:23,698
Holy cricket, you're Harry Potter!

323
00:37:23,865 --> 00:37:27,493
I'm Hermione Granger.
And you are...?

324
00:37:28,202 --> 00:37:31,372
- I'm Ron Weasley.
- Pleasure.

325
00:37:31,581 --> 00:37:36,669
You two better change into robes.
I expect we'll be arriving soon.

326
00:37:40,840 --> 00:37:44,260
You've got dirt on your nose.
Did you know?

327
00:37:44,469 --> 00:37:46,471
Just there.

328
00:37:58,775 --> 00:38:02,570
Right, then.
First years, this way, please!

329
00:38:02,779 --> 00:38:08,034
Come on, first years, don't be shy.
Come on now, hurry up.

330
00:38:14,957 --> 00:38:18,002
- Hello, Harry.
- Hi, Hagrid.

331
00:38:19,087 --> 00:38:23,383
Right, then. This way to the boats.
Come on now, follow me.

332
00:39:09,095 --> 00:39:10,888
Wicked.

333
00:39:39,000 --> 00:39:41,294
Welcome to Hogwarts.

334
00:39:41,502 --> 00:39:45,464
Shortly, you'll pass through
these doors and join your classmates.

335
00:39:45,673 --> 00:39:50,803
But before you take your seats,
you must be sorted into your houses.

336
00:39:51,012 --> 00:39:54,140
They are Gryffindor, Hufflepuff...

337
00:39:54,348 --> 00:39:58,769
...Ravenclaw and Slytherin.

338
00:39:59,186 --> 00:40:04,191
While you're here, your house
will be like your family.

339
00:40:04,859 --> 00:40:08,362
Your triumphs will earn you points.

340
00:40:08,571 --> 00:40:12,700
Any rule-breaking
and you will lose points.

341
00:40:12,909 --> 00:40:18,205
At the end of the year, the house
with the most points wins the house cup.

342
00:40:18,497 --> 00:40:19,749
Trevor!

343
00:40:28,716 --> 00:40:30,301
Sorry.

344
00:40:30,509 --> 00:40:34,430
The Sorting Ceremony
will begin momentarily.

345
00:40:35,765 --> 00:40:39,185
It's true then,
what they're saying on the train.

346
00:40:39,560 --> 00:40:42,188
Harry Potter has come to Hogwarts.

347
00:40:42,396 --> 00:40:43,773
Harry Potter?

348
00:40:44,440 --> 00:40:47,151
This is Crabbe and Goyle.

349
00:40:47,360 --> 00:40:49,654
And I'm Malfoy.

350
00:40:49,945 --> 00:40:52,239
Draco Malfoy.

351
00:40:54,241 --> 00:40:57,870
Think my name's funny, do you?
I've no need to ask yours.

352
00:40:58,079 --> 00:41:03,793
Red hair and a hand-me-down robe?
You must be a Weasley.

353
00:41:04,752 --> 00:41:08,798
You'll find out some wizarding families
are better than others.

354
00:41:09,006 --> 00:41:12,760
You don't want to go making friends
with the wrong sort.

355
00:41:12,968 --> 00:41:15,179
I can help you there.

356
00:41:17,431 --> 00:41:21,227
I think I can tell the wrong sort
for myself, thanks.

357
00:41:26,899 --> 00:41:29,068
We're ready for you now.
Follow me.

358
00:41:47,670 --> 00:41:52,174
The ceiling isn't real. It's bewitched
to look like the night sky.

359
00:41:52,466 --> 00:41:55,428
I read about it
in Hogwarts, A History.

360
00:42:08,649 --> 00:42:11,485
Will you wait along here, please?

361
00:42:12,945 --> 00:42:15,698
Now, before we begin...

362
00:42:15,865 --> 00:42:19,160
...Professor Dumbledore would like
to say a few words.

363
00:42:19,410 --> 00:42:24,165
I have a few start-of-term notices
I wish to announce.

364
00:42:24,540 --> 00:42:26,667
The first years, please note...

365
00:42:26,959 --> 00:42:32,965
...that the Dark Forest is
strictly forbidden to all students.

366
00:42:33,174 --> 00:42:38,762
Also, our caretaker, Mr. Filch,
has asked me to remind you...

367
00:42:38,971 --> 00:42:43,517
...that the third-floor corridor
is out of bounds...

368
00:42:43,851 --> 00:42:48,105
...to everyone who does not wish
to die a most painful death.

369
00:42:49,481 --> 00:42:51,400
Thank you.

370
00:42:53,152 --> 00:42:57,281
When I call your name,
you will come forth.

371
00:42:57,489 --> 00:43:01,076
I shall place the Sorting Hat
on your head...

372
00:43:01,285 --> 00:43:04,496
...and you will be sorted
into your houses.

373
00:43:04,705 --> 00:43:07,333
Hermione Granger.

374
00:43:09,543 --> 00:43:12,212
Oh, no. Okay, relax.

375
00:43:12,588 --> 00:43:15,966
Mental, that one, I'm telling you.

376
00:43:21,472 --> 00:43:25,267
Right, then. Right.

377
00:43:25,517 --> 00:43:29,146
Okay. Gryffindor!

378
00:43:37,863 --> 00:43:40,699
Draco Malfoy.

379
00:43:45,204 --> 00:43:47,498
Slytherin!

380
00:43:48,374 --> 00:43:51,377
Every wizard who went bad
was in Slytherin.

381
00:43:51,543 --> 00:43:54,088
Susan Bones.

382
00:44:02,680 --> 00:44:04,765
Harry, what is it?

383
00:44:04,973 --> 00:44:07,726
Nothing. Nothing, I'm fine.

384
00:44:07,935 --> 00:44:09,395
Let's see....

385
00:44:09,645 --> 00:44:13,982
I know! Hufflepuff!

386
00:44:15,734 --> 00:44:18,195
Ronald Weasley.

387
00:44:31,959 --> 00:44:37,047
Another Weasley!
I know just what to do with you.

388
00:44:37,756 --> 00:44:40,050
Gryffindor!

389
00:44:46,265 --> 00:44:48,725
Harry Potter.

390
00:45:06,785 --> 00:45:09,788
Difficult, very difficult.

391
00:45:09,955 --> 00:45:13,959
Plenty of courage, I see.
Not a bad mind, either.

392
00:45:14,168 --> 00:45:16,462
There's talent, oh, yes.

393
00:45:16,670 --> 00:45:20,507
And a thirst to prove yourself.

394
00:45:20,716 --> 00:45:22,885
But where to put you?

395
00:45:23,469 --> 00:45:25,971
Not Slytherin, not Slytherin!

396
00:45:26,180 --> 00:45:29,850
Not Slytherin, eh? Are you sure?

397
00:45:30,058 --> 00:45:34,980
You could be great, you know.
It's all here, in your head.

398
00:45:35,147 --> 00:45:40,485
And Slytherin will help you on the way
to greatness, no doubt about that.

399
00:45:40,819 --> 00:45:45,449
No? Well, if you're sure.

400
00:45:45,657 --> 00:45:47,451
Better be...

401
00:45:47,659 --> 00:45:49,620
...Gryffindor!

402
00:46:15,145 --> 00:46:17,898
Your attention, please.

403
00:46:19,942 --> 00:46:22,653
Let the feast begin.

404
00:46:39,586 --> 00:46:41,171
I'm half and half.

405
00:46:41,338 --> 00:46:44,549
Me dad's a Muggle. Mum's a witch.

406
00:46:44,758 --> 00:46:48,303
Bit of a nasty shock for him
when he found out.

407
00:46:49,346 --> 00:46:53,100
Percy, who's that teacher
talking to Professor Quirrell?

408
00:46:53,433 --> 00:46:56,561
Professor Snape,
head of Slytherin house.

409
00:46:56,770 --> 00:46:58,730
- What's he teach?
- Potions.

410
00:46:58,897 --> 00:47:04,528
But he fancies the Dark Arts.
He's been after Quirrell's job for years.

411
00:47:09,032 --> 00:47:11,368
Hello! How are you?

412
00:47:11,576 --> 00:47:14,955
Welcome to Gryffindor.

413
00:47:25,006 --> 00:47:27,509
It's the Bloody Baron!

414
00:47:32,222 --> 00:47:34,975
Hello, Sir Nicholas.
Have a nice summer?

415
00:47:35,183 --> 00:47:40,605
Dismal. Once again, my request to join
the Headless Hunt has been denied.

416
00:47:43,650 --> 00:47:46,611
I know you.
You're Nearly Headless Nick.

417
00:47:46,778 --> 00:47:49,531
I prefer Sir Nicholas,
if you don't mind.

418
00:47:49,740 --> 00:47:53,243
"Nearly" headless?
How can you be nearly headless?

419
00:47:53,535 --> 00:47:55,495
Like this.

420
00:48:05,547 --> 00:48:09,426
Gryffindors, follow me, please.
Keep up. Thank you.

421
00:48:09,634 --> 00:48:13,930
Ravenclaw, follow me. This way.

422
00:48:14,139 --> 00:48:17,517
This is the most direct path
to the dormitories.

423
00:48:17,684 --> 00:48:21,938
Keep an eye on the staircases.
They like to change.

424
00:48:31,031 --> 00:48:36,828
Keep up, please, and follow me.
Quickly now, come on. Come on.

425
00:48:37,037 --> 00:48:39,706
That picture's moving.

426
00:48:39,915 --> 00:48:43,376
- Look at that one.
- I think she fancies you.

427
00:48:45,170 --> 00:48:47,506
- Look!
- Who's that girl?

428
00:48:47,714 --> 00:48:50,217
Welcome to Hogwarts.

429
00:49:06,233 --> 00:49:07,859
Password?

430
00:49:08,276 --> 00:49:11,154
Caput Draconis.

431
00:49:17,869 --> 00:49:22,749
Follow me, everyone. Keep up.
Quickly, come on.

432
00:49:25,460 --> 00:49:27,879
Gather around here.

433
00:49:29,547 --> 00:49:32,884
Welcome to the Gryffindor common room.

434
00:49:33,093 --> 00:49:37,514
Boys' dormitory is upstairs to the left.
Girls, the same on your right.

435
00:49:37,722 --> 00:49:40,809
Your belongings have
already been brought up.

436
00:50:49,085 --> 00:50:50,670
Made it!

437
00:50:50,879 --> 00:50:55,508
Can you imagine the look on old
McGonagall's face if we were late?

438
00:50:58,553 --> 00:51:03,516
- That was bloody brilliant!
- Thank you for that assessment.

439
00:51:03,725 --> 00:51:08,021
It'd be better if I transfigured
Mr. Potter and you into a watch.

440
00:51:08,188 --> 00:51:11,441
- Then one of you might be on time.
- We got lost.

441
00:51:11,649 --> 00:51:17,447
Then perhaps a map? I trust you
don't need one to find your seats.

442
00:51:25,580 --> 00:51:31,294
There will be no foolish wand-waving
or silly incantations in this class.

443
00:51:31,503 --> 00:51:35,131
As such, I don't expect
many of you to appreciate...

444
00:51:35,340 --> 00:51:39,093
...the subtle science and exact art
that is potion-making.

445
00:51:39,260 --> 00:51:42,347
However, for those select few...

446
00:51:43,264 --> 00:51:46,643
...who possess the predisposition...

447
00:51:50,230 --> 00:51:53,608
...I can teach you
how to bewitch the mind...

448
00:51:53,816 --> 00:51:56,736
...and ensnare the senses.

449
00:51:56,903 --> 00:51:59,489
I can tell you how to bottle fame...

450
00:51:59,656 --> 00:52:05,537
...brew glory and even
put a stopper in death.

451
00:52:09,874 --> 00:52:15,964
Then again, maybe some of you have come
to Hogwarts in possession of abilities...

452
00:52:16,130 --> 00:52:19,634
...so formidable that
you feel confident enough...

453
00:52:19,842 --> 00:52:23,263
...to not pay attention.

454
00:52:29,769 --> 00:52:32,397
Mr. Potter.

455
00:52:33,606 --> 00:52:37,443
Our new celebrity.

456
00:52:39,612 --> 00:52:45,410
What would I get if I added root
of asphodel to an infusion of wormwood?

457
00:52:48,663 --> 00:52:51,082
You don't know? Let's try again.

458
00:52:51,291 --> 00:52:55,878
Where would you look
if I asked you to find a bezoar?

459
00:52:57,171 --> 00:52:58,589
I don't know, sir.

460
00:52:58,840 --> 00:53:02,719
What is the difference
between monkshood and wolfsbane?

461
00:53:05,263 --> 00:53:07,515
I don't know, sir.

462
00:53:08,558 --> 00:53:10,226
Pity.

463
00:53:11,602 --> 00:53:15,773
Clearly, fame isn't everything...

464
00:53:16,566 --> 00:53:19,360
...is it, Mr. Potter?

465
00:53:21,571 --> 00:53:27,118
Eye of rabbit, harp string hum
Turn this water into rum

466
00:53:28,369 --> 00:53:29,912
Eye of rabbit....

467
00:53:30,246 --> 00:53:32,915
What's Seamus trying to do
to the water?

468
00:53:33,124 --> 00:53:37,920
Turn it to rum. Actually managed
a weak tea yesterday, before--

469
00:53:44,594 --> 00:53:46,512
Mail's here.

470
00:54:18,795 --> 00:54:21,756
Can I borrow this? Thanks.

471
00:54:25,676 --> 00:54:27,929
Look, Neville's got a Remembrall.

472
00:54:28,137 --> 00:54:33,559
I've read about those. The smoke turns
red when you've forgotten something.

473
00:54:33,935 --> 00:54:37,313
The problem is, I can't remember
what I've forgotten.

474
00:54:37,605 --> 00:54:40,983
Somebody broke into Gringotts. Listen.

475
00:54:41,192 --> 00:54:44,904
"Believed to be the work
of Dark wizards or witches...

476
00:54:45,112 --> 00:54:50,868
...Gringotts goblins acknowledge
the breach but insist nothing was taken.

477
00:54:51,077 --> 00:54:56,832
The vault in question, number 713,
had been emptied earlier that same day."

478
00:54:56,999 --> 00:55:01,254
That's odd. That's the vault
Hagrid and I went to.

479
00:55:10,179 --> 00:55:13,933
- Good afternoon, class.
- Good afternoon, Madam Hooch.

480
00:55:14,141 --> 00:55:16,936
Good afternoon, Amanda.
Good afternoon.

481
00:55:18,229 --> 00:55:20,690
Welcome to your first flying lesson.

482
00:55:20,898 --> 00:55:24,860
What are you waiting for?
Step up to your broomstick.

483
00:55:25,027 --> 00:55:30,658
Come on now, hurry up. Stick your hand
over the broom and say, "Up."

484
00:55:30,866 --> 00:55:32,785
Up!

485
00:55:32,994 --> 00:55:33,995
Up.

486
00:55:35,496 --> 00:55:37,290
Up.

487
00:55:39,041 --> 00:55:40,626
Up. Up!

488
00:55:40,835 --> 00:55:42,837
With feeling.

489
00:55:51,512 --> 00:55:53,639
Shut up, Harry.

490
00:55:53,848 --> 00:55:58,519
Now, once you've got hold of
your broom, I want you to mount it.

491
00:55:58,728 --> 00:56:02,690
Grip it tight. You don't wanna be
sliding off the end.

492
00:56:03,107 --> 00:56:08,070
When I blow my whistle, I want you
to kick off from the ground, hard.

493
00:56:08,279 --> 00:56:12,116
Keep your broom steady,
hover for a moment...

494
00:56:12,325 --> 00:56:16,620
...then lean forward slightly
and touch back down.

495
00:56:16,829 --> 00:56:19,957
On my whistle. Three, two....

496
00:56:22,418 --> 00:56:23,794
Mr. Longbottom.

497
00:56:28,424 --> 00:56:31,302
- Mr. Longbottom!
- Down, down!

498
00:56:31,510 --> 00:56:32,720
Neville!

499
00:56:36,474 --> 00:56:39,143
Come back down this instant!

500
00:57:08,130 --> 00:57:10,508
Everyone out of the way!

501
00:57:16,055 --> 00:57:18,224
Is he all right?

502
00:57:18,557 --> 00:57:24,313
Oh, dear, it's a broken wrist.
Poor boy. Come on now, up you get.

503
00:57:25,564 --> 00:57:30,236
Keep your feet on the ground
while I take him to the hospital wing.

504
00:57:30,444 --> 00:57:34,114
Understand? If I see
a single broom in the air...

505
00:57:34,323 --> 00:57:39,578
...the one riding it will be expelled
before they can say Quidditch.

506
00:57:39,787 --> 00:57:41,705
Did you see his face?

507
00:57:41,914 --> 00:57:45,793
If he had squeezed this, he'd have
remembered to fall on his arse.

508
00:57:46,001 --> 00:57:48,462
Give it here, Malfoy.

509
00:57:49,338 --> 00:57:53,008
No. I'll leave it somewhere
for Longbottom to find.

510
00:57:57,179 --> 00:57:59,640
How about on the roof?

511
00:58:00,850 --> 00:58:04,687
What's the matter, Potter?
Bit beyond your reach?

512
00:58:07,189 --> 00:58:11,026
Harry, no way!
You heard what Madam Hooch said.

513
00:58:11,193 --> 00:58:14,071
Besides, you don't know how to fly.

514
00:58:14,405 --> 00:58:16,365
What an idiot.

515
00:58:19,702 --> 00:58:23,163
Give it here or I'll
knock you off your broom!

516
00:58:23,372 --> 00:58:25,499
Is that so?

517
00:58:28,669 --> 00:58:30,963
Have it your way, then.

518
00:59:03,662 --> 00:59:07,333
- Nice going, Harry.
- That was wicked, Harry!

519
00:59:07,541 --> 00:59:09,585
Harry Potter!

520
00:59:10,544 --> 00:59:12,546
Follow me.

521
00:59:24,224 --> 00:59:26,477
You wait here.

522
00:59:28,270 --> 00:59:33,567
Professor Quirrell, excuse me.
Could I borrow Wood for a moment?

523
00:59:33,776 --> 00:59:35,569
Yes, of course.

524
00:59:41,200 --> 00:59:46,955
Potter, this is Oliver Wood.
Wood, I have found you a Seeker.

525
00:59:49,124 --> 00:59:52,586
Have you heard? Harry Potter's
the new Gryffindor Seeker.

526
00:59:52,795 --> 00:59:55,047
I always knew he'd do well.

527
00:59:55,506 --> 00:59:59,593
Seeker? But first years
never make the house teams.

528
00:59:59,760 --> 01:00:04,264
- You must be the youngest player in--
- A century, McGonagall says.

529
01:00:04,473 --> 01:00:07,101
Well done, Harry.
Wood's just told us.

530
01:00:07,309 --> 01:00:09,812
Fred and George are on the team.
Beaters.

531
01:00:10,020 --> 01:00:13,732
Our job is to make sure you
don't get bloodied up too bad.

532
01:00:13,941 --> 01:00:16,610
Can't make any promises.
Rough game, Quidditch.

533
01:00:16,819 --> 01:00:20,739
But no one's died in years.
Someone vanishes occasionally.

534
01:00:20,989 --> 01:00:23,742
But they'll turn up in a month or two.

535
01:00:23,951 --> 01:00:29,623
Go on. Quidditch is great. Best game
there is, and you'll be great too.

536
01:00:29,832 --> 01:00:33,043
I've never played.
What if I make a fool of myself?

537
01:00:33,418 --> 01:00:38,257
You won't make a fool of yourself.
It's in your blood.

538
01:00:46,849 --> 01:00:50,644
You never told me your father
was a Seeker too.

539
01:00:51,478 --> 01:00:53,647
I didn't know.

540
01:00:58,193 --> 01:01:02,739
I'm telling you, it's spooky.
She knows more about you than you do.

541
01:01:02,948 --> 01:01:05,284
Who doesn't?

542
01:01:06,201 --> 01:01:08,328
What's happening?

543
01:01:08,537 --> 01:01:12,749
The staircases change, remember?

544
01:01:18,213 --> 01:01:22,676
- Let's go this way.
- Before the staircase moves again.

545
01:01:30,309 --> 01:01:33,729
Does anybody feel like
we shouldn't be here?

546
01:01:33,937 --> 01:01:36,064
We're not supposed to be here.

547
01:01:36,273 --> 01:01:40,235
This is the third floor.
It's forbidden.

548
01:01:41,403 --> 01:01:42,988
Let's go.

549
01:01:45,198 --> 01:01:48,076
- It's Filch's cat!
- Run!

550
01:01:51,872 --> 01:01:55,292
Quick, let's hide through that door!

551
01:02:00,297 --> 01:02:02,382
- It's locked!
- We're done for!

552
01:02:02,591 --> 01:02:04,760
Move over!

553
01:02:05,719 --> 01:02:07,846
Alohomora.

554
01:02:08,764 --> 01:02:10,641
Get in.

555
01:02:11,892 --> 01:02:13,018
Alohomora?

556
01:02:13,185 --> 01:02:15,729
Standard Book of Spells,
chapter seven.

557
01:02:15,937 --> 01:02:19,316
Anyone here, my sweet?

558
01:02:25,572 --> 01:02:26,531
Come on.

559
01:02:27,449 --> 01:02:29,951
- Filch is gone.
- He thinks this door's locked.

560
01:02:30,118 --> 01:02:33,747
- It was locked.
- And for good reason.

561
01:02:59,439 --> 01:03:04,945
What are they doing, keeping a thing
like that locked up in a school?

562
01:03:05,153 --> 01:03:08,782
Didn't you see what
it was standing on?

563
01:03:08,990 --> 01:03:13,203
I wasn't looking at its feet!
I was preoccupied with its heads.

564
01:03:13,412 --> 01:03:16,289
Or maybe you didn't notice.
There were three!

565
01:03:16,498 --> 01:03:20,127
It was standing on a trap door.
It wasn't there by accident.

566
01:03:20,335 --> 01:03:23,922
- It's guarding something.
- Guarding something?

567
01:03:24,297 --> 01:03:28,135
That's right. Now, if you two don't mind,
I'm going to bed...

568
01:03:28,343 --> 01:03:31,930
...before you come up with another idea
to get us killed.

569
01:03:32,139 --> 01:03:35,267
Or worse, expelled.

570
01:03:38,520 --> 01:03:42,774
She needs to sort out her priorities.

571
01:03:47,362 --> 01:03:51,575
Quidditch is easy to understand.
Each team has seven players.

572
01:03:51,783 --> 01:03:57,539
Three Chasers, two Beaters,
one Keeper and a Seeker. That's you.

573
01:04:02,627 --> 01:04:06,756
There are three kinds of balls.
This one's called the Quaffle.

574
01:04:06,965 --> 01:04:12,929
The Chasers handle the Quaffle and try
to put it through one of those hoops.

575
01:04:13,138 --> 01:04:17,517
The Keeper, that's me,
defends the hoops. With me so far?

576
01:04:17,726 --> 01:04:22,188
I think so. What are those?

577
01:04:24,482 --> 01:04:26,651
You better take this.

578
01:04:36,703 --> 01:04:39,456
Careful now, it's coming back.

579
01:04:46,087 --> 01:04:49,674
Not bad, Potter.
You'd make a fair Beater.

580
01:05:06,358 --> 01:05:08,652
What was that?

581
01:05:09,444 --> 01:05:13,156
Bludger. Nasty little buggers.

582
01:05:13,365 --> 01:05:16,868
But you are a Seeker.

583
01:05:20,455 --> 01:05:25,043
The only thing I want you
to worry about is this.

584
01:05:25,251 --> 01:05:27,796
The Golden Snitch.

585
01:05:28,004 --> 01:05:31,007
- I like this ball.
- You like it now.

586
01:05:31,216 --> 01:05:35,220
Just wait. It's wicked fast
and damn near impossible to see.

587
01:05:35,428 --> 01:05:37,389
What do I do with it?

588
01:05:37,597 --> 01:05:40,850
You catch it.
Before the other team's Seeker.

589
01:05:41,059 --> 01:05:43,561
You catch this, the game's over.

590
01:05:43,770 --> 01:05:47,732
You catch this, Potter,
and we win.

591
01:05:56,783 --> 01:06:02,122
One of a wizard's most rudimentary
skills is levitation...

592
01:06:02,330 --> 01:06:06,292
...or the ability to make objects fly.

593
01:06:06,501 --> 01:06:08,920
Do you have your feathers? Good.

594
01:06:09,129 --> 01:06:14,259
Now, don't forget the nice wrist
movement we've been practicing.

595
01:06:14,467 --> 01:06:18,179
The swish and flick. Everyone.

596
01:06:18,388 --> 01:06:23,977
The swish and flick. Good.
Oh, and enunciate.

597
01:06:24,686 --> 01:06:28,982
Wingardium Leviosa.
Off you go, then.

598
01:06:30,066 --> 01:06:32,569
Wingardium Leviosa.

599
01:06:32,819 --> 01:06:35,113
Wingardium Leviosa.

600
01:06:38,992 --> 01:06:43,246
No, stop, stop, stop! You're going
to take someone's eye out.

601
01:06:43,454 --> 01:06:49,460
Besides, you're saying it wrong.
It's Leviosa, not Leviosar.

602
01:06:50,003 --> 01:06:54,257
You do it then, if you're so clever.
Go on, go on.

603
01:06:55,508 --> 01:06:58,595
Wingardium Leviosa.

604
01:07:06,102 --> 01:07:11,691
Well done! See here, everyone,
Miss Granger's done it!

605
01:07:11,900 --> 01:07:13,610
Splendid!

606
01:07:15,195 --> 01:07:17,322
Well done, dear.

607
01:07:21,618 --> 01:07:25,663
I think we're going to need
another feather over here.

608
01:07:32,211 --> 01:07:36,466
"It's Leviosa, not Leviosar."

609
01:07:36,674 --> 01:07:42,013
She's a nightmare, honestly!
No wonder she hasn't got any friends.

610
01:07:42,722 --> 01:07:45,224
I think she heard you.

611
01:08:13,920 --> 01:08:16,005
Where's Hermione?

612
01:08:16,214 --> 01:08:19,342
Parvati said she wouldn't
come out of the bathroom.

613
01:08:19,550 --> 01:08:23,596
She said that she'd been in there
all afternoon, crying.

614
01:08:28,017 --> 01:08:31,729
Troll in the dungeon!

615
01:08:31,938 --> 01:08:35,274
Troll in the dungeon!

616
01:08:38,111 --> 01:08:40,405
Thought you ought to know.

617
01:08:47,328 --> 01:08:50,123
Silence!

618
01:08:51,708 --> 01:08:55,753
Everyone will please not panic!

619
01:08:56,462 --> 01:08:58,047
Now...

620
01:08:58,256 --> 01:09:02,802
...prefects will lead their house
back to the dormitories.

621
01:09:03,469 --> 01:09:08,307
Teachers will follow me
to the dungeons.

622
01:09:19,360 --> 01:09:22,530
Gryffindors, keep up, please,
and stay alert.

623
01:09:22,738 --> 01:09:24,490
How could a troll get in?

624
01:09:24,699 --> 01:09:29,871
Not on its own. Trolls are really stupid.
Probably people playing jokes.

625
01:09:30,079 --> 01:09:34,083
- What?
- Hermione! She doesn't know.

626
01:09:46,137 --> 01:09:49,390
I think the troll's left the dungeon.

627
01:09:53,269 --> 01:09:55,438
It's going into the girls' bathroom.

628
01:10:26,510 --> 01:10:28,846
Hermione, move!

629
01:10:32,266 --> 01:10:36,437
Help! Help!

630
01:10:38,439 --> 01:10:40,524
Hey, pea brain!

631
01:10:52,912 --> 01:10:54,789
Help!

632
01:11:15,977 --> 01:11:18,270
Do something!

633
01:11:19,772 --> 01:11:23,734
- What?
- Anything!

634
01:11:24,318 --> 01:11:26,779
- Hurry up!
- Swish and flick.

635
01:11:26,988 --> 01:11:29,281
Wingardium Leviosa.

636
01:11:40,251 --> 01:11:42,253
Cool.

637
01:12:06,610 --> 01:12:09,447
Is it dead?

638
01:12:09,655 --> 01:12:13,617
I don't think so. Just knocked out.

639
01:12:19,874 --> 01:12:22,209
Troll boogers.

640
01:12:24,628 --> 01:12:28,215
Oh, my goodness!
Explain yourselves, both of you!

641
01:12:28,466 --> 01:12:33,053
- Well, what it is--
- It's my fault, Professor McGonagall.

642
01:12:35,264 --> 01:12:36,432
Miss Granger?

643
01:12:37,308 --> 01:12:42,396
I went looking for the troll.
I thought I could handle it.

644
01:12:42,605 --> 01:12:44,523
But I was wrong.

645
01:12:44,732 --> 01:12:49,737
If Harry and Ron hadn't come
and found me, I'd probably be dead.

646
01:12:50,696 --> 01:12:55,201
Be that as it may, it was
an extremely foolish thing to do.

647
01:12:55,409 --> 01:13:01,040
I expected more rational behavior
and am very disappointed in you.

648
01:13:01,248 --> 01:13:04,251
Five points will be taken
from Gryffindor...

649
01:13:04,460 --> 01:13:08,047
...for your serious lack of judgment.

650
01:13:08,506 --> 01:13:10,508
As for you two gentlemen...

651
01:13:10,716 --> 01:13:14,136
...I just hope you realize
how fortunate you are.

652
01:13:14,345 --> 01:13:17,765
Not many first-year students
could take on a troll...

653
01:13:17,973 --> 01:13:20,601
...and live to tell the tale.

654
01:13:20,809 --> 01:13:23,270
Five points...

655
01:13:24,647 --> 01:13:27,775
...will be awarded to each of you...

656
01:13:29,360 --> 01:13:32,404
...for sheer dumb luck.

657
01:13:38,035 --> 01:13:41,747
Perhaps you ought to go.
It might wake up.

658
01:13:49,672 --> 01:13:52,383
Take a bit of toast, mate. Go on.

659
01:13:52,591 --> 01:13:55,844
Ron's right.
You'll need your strength today.

660
01:13:56,011 --> 01:13:58,222
I'm not hungry.

661
01:13:58,806 --> 01:14:01,392
Good luck today, Potter.

662
01:14:02,184 --> 01:14:04,478
You've proven yourself against a troll.

663
01:14:04,937 --> 01:14:08,190
A game of Quidditch
should be easy work.

664
01:14:08,399 --> 01:14:11,443
Even if it is against Slytherin.

665
01:14:19,201 --> 01:14:22,579
- That explains the blood.
- Blood?

666
01:14:23,038 --> 01:14:27,167
Last night, I'm guessing Snape let
the troll in as a diversion...

667
01:14:27,376 --> 01:14:29,962
...so he could get past that dog.

668
01:14:30,170 --> 01:14:32,965
But he got bit,
that's why he's limping.

669
01:14:33,173 --> 01:14:35,926
But why would anyone go near that dog?

670
01:14:36,135 --> 01:14:39,346
At Gringotts, Hagrid took
something out of the vault.

671
01:14:39,555 --> 01:14:42,808
Said it was Hogwarts business,
very secret.

672
01:14:43,017 --> 01:14:44,184
You're saying--

673
01:14:44,393 --> 01:14:48,814
That's what the dog's guarding.
That's what Snape wants.

674
01:15:01,994 --> 01:15:05,956
- Bit early for mail, isn't it?
- But I never get mail.

675
01:15:06,498 --> 01:15:08,041
Let's open it.

676
01:15:18,177 --> 01:15:19,470
It's a broomstick.

677
01:15:20,262 --> 01:15:24,433
That's not just a broomstick,
it's a Nimbus 2000!

678
01:15:25,851 --> 01:15:27,936
But who--?

679
01:15:49,500 --> 01:15:52,085
- Scared, Harry?
- A little.

680
01:15:52,294 --> 01:15:55,964
It's all right. I felt the same way
before my first game.

681
01:15:56,173 --> 01:15:59,593
- What happened?
- I don't really remember.

682
01:15:59,968 --> 01:16:02,596
I took a Bludger to the head
two minutes in.

683
01:16:02,804 --> 01:16:05,682
Woke up in hospital a week later.

684
01:16:27,829 --> 01:16:31,208
Welcome to Hogwarts' first
Quidditch game of the season.

685
01:16:31,416 --> 01:16:36,088
Today's game,
Slytherin versus Gryffindor!

686
01:17:06,410 --> 01:17:08,870
The players take their positions...

687
01:17:09,079 --> 01:17:12,874
...as Madam Hooch steps onto
the field to begin the game!

688
01:17:13,083 --> 01:17:16,420
Now, I want a nice, clean game...

689
01:17:17,004 --> 01:17:19,464
...from all of you!

690
01:17:24,594 --> 01:17:27,514
The Bludgers are up,
followed by the Golden Snitch.

691
01:17:27,723 --> 01:17:30,434
Remember, the Snitch
is worth 150 points.

692
01:17:30,642 --> 01:17:34,438
The Seeker who catches the Snitch
ends the game.

693
01:17:40,610 --> 01:17:45,073
The Quaffle is released
and the game begins!

694
01:18:03,425 --> 01:18:08,138
Angelina Johnson scores!
Ten points for Gryffindor!

695
01:18:13,351 --> 01:18:14,644
Well done!

696
01:18:19,024 --> 01:18:24,696
Slytherin takes the Quaffle.
Bletchley passes to Captain Marcus Flint.

697
01:18:56,770 --> 01:18:59,606
Another 10 points to Gryffindor!

698
01:19:13,370 --> 01:19:15,247
Give me that!

699
01:19:46,736 --> 01:19:49,322
Take that side!

700
01:20:38,788 --> 01:20:42,042
What's going on
with Harry's broomstick?

701
01:20:50,967 --> 01:20:53,219
It's Snape.
He's jinxing the broom!

702
01:20:53,428 --> 01:20:57,766
- Jinxing the broom? What do we do?
- Leave it to me.

703
01:21:19,537 --> 01:21:21,039
Come on, Hermione!

704
01:21:35,178 --> 01:21:38,932
Lacarnum Inflamarae.

705
01:21:45,980 --> 01:21:49,025
Fire! You're on fire!

706
01:22:06,918 --> 01:22:09,045
Go, go, go, go!

707
01:23:01,055 --> 01:23:03,433
Looks like he's gonna be sick.

708
01:23:04,517 --> 01:23:06,019
He's got the Snitch!

709
01:23:06,227 --> 01:23:10,231
Harry Potter receives 150 points
for catching the Snitch!

710
01:23:10,440 --> 01:23:12,150
Gryffindor wins!

711
01:23:55,777 --> 01:23:59,989
Nonsense! Why would Snape
put a curse on Harry's broom?

712
01:24:00,198 --> 01:24:04,118
Who knows? Why was he trying
to get past that three-headed dog?

713
01:24:04,327 --> 01:24:06,746
- Who told you about Fluffy?
- Fluffy?

714
01:24:06,954 --> 01:24:10,625
- That thing has a name?
- Of course he has a name. He's mine.

715
01:24:10,833 --> 01:24:16,130
I bought him off an Irishman.
I lent him to Dumbledore to guard--

716
01:24:16,339 --> 01:24:20,927
Shouldn't have said that.
No more questions! That's top-secret.

717
01:24:21,511 --> 01:24:25,515
But whatever Fluffy's guarding,
Snape's trying to steal it.

718
01:24:25,723 --> 01:24:29,185
Codswallop. Professor Snape
is a Hogwarts teacher.

719
01:24:29,685 --> 01:24:34,774
Teacher or not, I know a spell when
I see one. I've read all about them.

720
01:24:34,982 --> 01:24:38,611
You've got to keep eye contact,
and Snape wasn't blinking.

721
01:24:38,820 --> 01:24:40,988
Exactly.

722
01:24:41,697 --> 01:24:44,492
Now, you listen to me,
all three of you.

723
01:24:44,659 --> 01:24:49,288
You're meddling in things that ought
not to be meddled in. It's dangerous.

724
01:24:49,497 --> 01:24:54,627
What that dog is guarding is
between Dumbledore and Nicholas Flamel.

725
01:24:54,836 --> 01:24:56,254
Nicholas Flamel?

726
01:24:57,255 --> 01:25:01,926
I shouldn't have said that.
I should not have said that.

727
01:25:02,135 --> 01:25:06,305
Nicholas Flamel.
Who's Nicholas Flamel?

728
01:25:06,514 --> 01:25:08,474
I don't know.

729
01:25:27,326 --> 01:25:30,162
Merry Christmas
Merry Christmas

730
01:25:30,371 --> 01:25:33,207
Ring the Hogwart bell

731
01:25:33,374 --> 01:25:36,168
Merry Christmas
Merry Christmas

732
01:25:36,377 --> 01:25:39,338
Cast a Christmas spell

733
01:25:52,935 --> 01:25:56,272
Knight to E-5.

734
01:26:03,946 --> 01:26:06,115
Queen to E-5.

735
01:26:11,746 --> 01:26:13,539
That's totally barbaric!

736
01:26:13,748 --> 01:26:17,335
That's wizard's chess.
I see you've packed.

737
01:26:17,543 --> 01:26:18,961
I see you haven't.

738
01:26:19,337 --> 01:26:24,508
Change of plans. My parents went
to Romania to visit my brother Charlie.

739
01:26:24,717 --> 01:26:28,512
- He's studying dragons there.
- Good. You can help Harry.

740
01:26:28,721 --> 01:26:32,141
He's going to the library
to look up Nicholas Flamel.

741
01:26:32,350 --> 01:26:35,811
We've looked a hundred times!

742
01:26:36,479 --> 01:26:41,734
Not in the restricted section.
Happy Christmas.

743
01:26:43,944 --> 01:26:46,864
I think we've had
a bad influence on her.

744
01:26:49,367 --> 01:26:53,746
Harry, wake up!
Come on, Harry, wake up!

745
01:27:03,631 --> 01:27:06,926
- Happy Christmas, Harry.
- Happy Christmas, Ron.

746
01:27:07,134 --> 01:27:09,303
What are you wearing?

747
01:27:09,970 --> 01:27:13,599
Oh, my mum made it.
Looks like you've got one too.

748
01:27:14,767 --> 01:27:17,186
- I've got presents?
- Yeah.

749
01:27:24,610 --> 01:27:26,695
There they are.

750
01:27:37,706 --> 01:27:41,210
"Your father left this
in my possession before he died.

751
01:27:41,419 --> 01:27:45,548
It is time it was returned to you.
Use it well."

752
01:28:02,398 --> 01:28:06,110
- What is it?
- Some kind of cloak.

753
01:28:06,402 --> 01:28:09,363
Well, let's see, then. Put it on.

754
01:28:14,702 --> 01:28:15,995
My body's gone!

755
01:28:16,203 --> 01:28:19,832
I know what that is.
That's an invisibility cloak!

756
01:28:20,374 --> 01:28:22,251
I'm invisible?

757
01:28:22,751 --> 01:28:27,173
They're really rare.
I wonder who gave it to you.

758
01:28:27,590 --> 01:28:32,428
There was no name.
It just said, "Use it well."

759
01:29:00,497 --> 01:29:06,378
Famous Fire-Eaters.
Fifteenth-Century Fiends.

760
01:29:06,587 --> 01:29:12,384
Flamel. Nicholas Flamel.
Where are you?

761
01:29:31,236 --> 01:29:33,113
Who's there?

762
01:29:39,244 --> 01:29:44,917
I know you're in there.
You can't hide.

763
01:29:52,299 --> 01:29:56,011
Who is it? Show yourself.

764
01:30:43,183 --> 01:30:44,601
Severus, I....

765
01:30:45,269 --> 01:30:49,148
You don't want me
as your enemy, Quirrell.

766
01:30:49,314 --> 01:30:54,069
- I don't know what you mean.
- You know perfectly well what I mean.

767
01:31:11,295 --> 01:31:14,506
We'll have another little chat soon.

768
01:31:14,715 --> 01:31:20,179
When you've had time to decide
where your loyalties lie.

769
01:31:20,387 --> 01:31:24,850
Professors. I found this
in the restricted section.

770
01:31:25,392 --> 01:31:30,439
It's still hot. That means
there's a student out of bed.

771
01:33:02,489 --> 01:33:04,366
Mum?

772
01:33:07,619 --> 01:33:09,621
Dad?

773
01:33:44,322 --> 01:33:49,286
Ron, you've really gotta see this!
Ron, you've gotta see this!

774
01:33:51,163 --> 01:33:54,040
Ron, come on, get out of bed!

775
01:33:54,249 --> 01:33:57,794
- Why?
- There's something you've got to see!

776
01:34:04,551 --> 01:34:08,805
Come on! Come!
Come look, it's my parents!

777
01:34:10,265 --> 01:34:12,267
I only see us.

778
01:34:12,476 --> 01:34:15,854
Look in properly.
Go on, stand there.

779
01:34:16,021 --> 01:34:21,943
- There. You see them, don't you?
- That's me! Only I'm head boy.

780
01:34:22,486 --> 01:34:24,821
And I'm holding the Quidditch Cup.

781
01:34:25,030 --> 01:34:29,201
And bloody hell!
I'm Quidditch captain too!

782
01:34:30,368 --> 01:34:32,829
I look good.

783
01:34:33,455 --> 01:34:37,292
Harry, do you think this mirror
shows the future?

784
01:34:37,500 --> 01:34:42,464
How can it?
Both my parents are dead.

785
01:35:05,570 --> 01:35:07,697
Back again, Harry?

786
01:35:10,867 --> 01:35:13,328
I see that you,
like many before you...

787
01:35:13,536 --> 01:35:17,707
...have discovered the delights
of the Mirror of Erised.

788
01:35:18,041 --> 01:35:22,212
I trust by now
you realize what it does.

789
01:35:23,546 --> 01:35:26,049
Let me give you a clue.

790
01:35:26,591 --> 01:35:28,760
The happiest man on earth...

791
01:35:28,927 --> 01:35:32,347
...would look in the mirror
and see only himself...

792
01:35:32,555 --> 01:35:34,891
...exactly as he is.

793
01:35:35,058 --> 01:35:40,188
So then, it shows us what we want.
Whatever we want.

794
01:35:40,355 --> 01:35:43,066
Yes. And no.

795
01:35:44,109 --> 01:35:46,611
It shows us nothing more or less...

796
01:35:46,778 --> 01:35:52,742
...than the deepest and most desperate
desires of our hearts.

797
01:35:52,951 --> 01:35:57,664
Now you, Harry, who have
never known your family...

798
01:35:57,872 --> 01:36:01,751
...you see them standing beside you.

799
01:36:01,960 --> 01:36:04,421
But remember this, Harry.

800
01:36:04,629 --> 01:36:10,510
This mirror gives us
neither knowledge...

801
01:36:10,719 --> 01:36:12,762
...or truth.

802
01:36:13,805 --> 01:36:19,769
Men have wasted away in front of it.
Even gone mad.

803
01:36:20,854 --> 01:36:25,024
That is why tomorrow,
it will be moved to a new home.

804
01:36:25,233 --> 01:36:27,152
And I must ask you...

805
01:36:28,069 --> 01:36:31,990
...not to go looking for it again.

806
01:36:32,741 --> 01:36:35,869
It does not do to dwell on dreams...

807
01:36:36,411 --> 01:36:39,289
...and forget to live.

808
01:37:34,010 --> 01:37:39,682
I had you looking in the wrong section.
How could I be so stupid?

809
01:37:39,933 --> 01:37:43,019
I checked this out weeks ago
for a bit of light reading.

810
01:37:43,228 --> 01:37:45,230
This is light?

811
01:37:49,943 --> 01:37:51,986
Of course! Here it is!

812
01:37:52,570 --> 01:37:56,491
Nicholas Flamel is the only known
maker of the Philosopher's Stone.

813
01:37:56,699 --> 01:37:57,867
The what?

814
01:37:58,534 --> 01:38:01,537
Honestly, don't you two read?

815
01:38:01,746 --> 01:38:06,334
"The Philosopher's Stone is a legendary
substance with astonishing powers.

816
01:38:06,501 --> 01:38:09,087
It'll transform any metal
into pure gold...

817
01:38:09,295 --> 01:38:13,299
...and produces the Elixir of Life
which will make the drinker immortal."

818
01:38:13,508 --> 01:38:15,718
- Immortal?
- It means you'll never die.

819
01:38:15,885 --> 01:38:18,012
I know what it means!

820
01:38:18,846 --> 01:38:23,601
"The only Stone currently in existence
belongs to Mr. Nicholas Flamel...

821
01:38:23,810 --> 01:38:28,898
...the noted alchemist who last year
celebrated his 665th birthday."

822
01:38:30,692 --> 01:38:32,860
That's what Fluffy's guarding.

823
01:38:33,027 --> 01:38:37,740
That's what's under the trap door.
The Philosopher's Stone.

824
01:38:54,549 --> 01:38:58,386
Don't wish to be rude,
but I'm in no state to entertain.

825
01:38:58,553 --> 01:39:01,264
We know about the Philosopher's Stone.

826
01:39:05,977 --> 01:39:11,107
- We think Snape's trying to steal it.
- Are you still on about him?

827
01:39:11,274 --> 01:39:14,068
We know he's after it.
We don't know why.

828
01:39:14,485 --> 01:39:18,948
Snape is one of the teachers
protecting the Stone. He won't steal it.

829
01:39:19,115 --> 01:39:20,074
What?

830
01:39:20,241 --> 01:39:23,536
You heard. Come on,
I'm a bit preoccupied today.

831
01:39:23,953 --> 01:39:26,497
Wait a minute.
"One of the teachers"?

832
01:39:26,664 --> 01:39:30,585
There are other things
defending the Stone, aren't there?

833
01:39:30,752 --> 01:39:33,379
- Spells, enchantments.
- Right.

834
01:39:33,588 --> 01:39:36,632
Waste of bloody time, if you ask me.

835
01:39:36,841 --> 01:39:38,926
Ain't no one gonna get past Fluffy.

836
01:39:39,177 --> 01:39:42,847
Ain't a soul knows how,
except for me and Dumbledore.

837
01:39:43,055 --> 01:39:46,642
I shouldn't have told you that.
I should not have told you that.

838
01:40:00,490 --> 01:40:05,620
- Hagrid, what exactly is that?
- That? It's....

839
01:40:05,828 --> 01:40:07,872
I know what that is!

840
01:40:08,039 --> 01:40:10,708
But, Hagrid, how did you get one?

841
01:40:11,000 --> 01:40:14,295
I won it. Off a stranger
I met down at the pub.

842
01:40:14,504 --> 01:40:18,633
Seemed quite glad to be rid of it,
as a matter of fact.

843
01:40:40,863 --> 01:40:43,074
Is that...

844
01:40:43,866 --> 01:40:45,034
...a dragon?

845
01:40:45,243 --> 01:40:49,664
That's not just a dragon.
That's a Norwegian Ridgeback.

846
01:40:49,872 --> 01:40:52,708
My brother works
with these in Romania.

847
01:40:52,875 --> 01:40:57,838
Isn't he beautiful? Oh, bless him.
Look, he knows his mummy.

848
01:40:58,464 --> 01:41:00,174
Hello, Norbert.

849
01:41:00,591 --> 01:41:04,845
- Norbert?
- He's gotta have a name, don't he?

850
01:41:05,555 --> 01:41:08,057
Don't you, Norbert?

851
01:41:15,022 --> 01:41:18,192
He'll have to be trained up a bit,
of course.

852
01:41:22,029 --> 01:41:24,073
Who's that?

853
01:41:25,866 --> 01:41:27,952
Malfoy.

854
01:41:28,703 --> 01:41:30,079
Oh, dear.

855
01:41:31,747 --> 01:41:36,585
Hagrid always wanted a dragon.
Told me so the first time I met him.

856
01:41:36,794 --> 01:41:40,881
It's crazy.
And worse, Malfoy knows.

857
01:41:41,048 --> 01:41:45,136
- I don't understand. Is that bad?
- It's bad.

858
01:41:45,469 --> 01:41:47,596
Good evening.

859
01:41:51,267 --> 01:41:54,186
Nothing, I repeat, nothing...

860
01:41:54,395 --> 01:41:57,982
...gives a student the right
to walk about at night.

861
01:41:58,149 --> 01:42:02,987
Therefore, as punishment for your actions,
50 points will be taken.

862
01:42:03,195 --> 01:42:05,573
- 50?!
- Each.

863
01:42:06,615 --> 01:42:08,993
To ensure it doesn't happen again...

864
01:42:09,160 --> 01:42:12,455
...all four of you
will receive detention.

865
01:42:13,456 --> 01:42:16,417
Excuse me, professor,
perhaps I heard you wrong.

866
01:42:16,584 --> 01:42:19,003
I thought you said the four of us.

867
01:42:19,170 --> 01:42:21,589
No, you heard me correctly.

868
01:42:21,797 --> 01:42:26,844
Honorable as your intentions were,
you too were out of bed after hours.

869
01:42:27,344 --> 01:42:30,264
You will join your classmates
in detention.

870
01:42:41,484 --> 01:42:45,488
A pity they let
the old punishments die.

871
01:42:45,696 --> 01:42:50,451
Was a time detention found you
hanging by your thumbs in the dungeons.

872
01:42:50,659 --> 01:42:53,454
God, I miss the screaming.

873
01:42:56,040 --> 01:42:59,335
You'll be serving detention
with Hagrid tonight.

874
01:42:59,502 --> 01:43:04,882
He's got a little job to do
inside the Dark Forest.

875
01:43:06,967 --> 01:43:09,887
A sorry lot, this, Hagrid.

876
01:43:11,347 --> 01:43:16,352
Good God, you're not still on
about that bloody dragon, are you?

877
01:43:18,646 --> 01:43:20,731
Norbert's gone.

878
01:43:21,190 --> 01:43:24,777
Dumbledore sent him off to Romania
to live in a colony.

879
01:43:25,027 --> 01:43:28,322
That's good, isn't it?
He's with his own kind.

880
01:43:28,489 --> 01:43:30,866
What if he don't like Romania?

881
01:43:31,033 --> 01:43:35,329
What if the other dragons are mean
to him? He's only a baby.

882
01:43:35,913 --> 01:43:41,210
For God's sake, pull yourself together.
You're going into the Forest.

883
01:43:41,418 --> 01:43:43,796
Got to have your wits about you.

884
01:43:44,004 --> 01:43:49,635
The Forest? I thought that was a joke.
We can't go in there.

885
01:43:50,052 --> 01:43:53,973
Students aren't allowed.
And there are...

886
01:43:55,516 --> 01:43:56,725
...werewolves.

887
01:43:57,184 --> 01:44:00,437
There's more than werewolves
in those trees.

888
01:44:00,646 --> 01:44:03,357
You can be sure of that.

889
01:44:05,317 --> 01:44:06,694
Nighty-night.

890
01:44:09,238 --> 01:44:12,533
Right. Let's go.

891
01:44:50,362 --> 01:44:52,740
Hagrid, what is that?

892
01:44:52,948 --> 01:44:56,368
What we're here for.
See that?

893
01:44:56,785 --> 01:45:02,249
That's unicorn blood, that is.
I found one dead a few weeks ago.

894
01:45:02,750 --> 01:45:07,338
Now, this one's been hurt bad
by something.

895
01:45:14,887 --> 01:45:20,601
So, it's our job to go
and find the poor beast.

896
01:45:20,809 --> 01:45:23,896
Ron, Hermione, come with me.

897
01:45:24,438 --> 01:45:27,733
And, Harry, you'll go with Malfoy.

898
01:45:29,193 --> 01:45:31,278
Okay. Then I get Fang.

899
01:45:31,445 --> 01:45:37,159
Fine. Just so you know,
he's a bloody coward.

900
01:45:40,871 --> 01:45:45,834
Wait till my father hears about this.
This is servant's stuff.

901
01:45:46,001 --> 01:45:49,963
If I didn't know better,
I'd say you were scared.

902
01:45:50,172 --> 01:45:53,092
I'm not scared, Potter.

903
01:45:53,926 --> 01:45:55,886
Do you hear that?

904
01:45:58,347 --> 01:45:59,807
Come on, Fang.

905
01:46:00,015 --> 01:46:01,475
Scared!

906
01:46:26,542 --> 01:46:28,752
What is it, Fang?

907
01:47:39,114 --> 01:47:44,620
Harry Potter, you must leave.
You are known to many creatures here.

908
01:47:44,828 --> 01:47:48,874
The Forest is not safe at this time.
Especially for you.

909
01:47:49,082 --> 01:47:51,793
What was that thing you saved me from?

910
01:47:51,960 --> 01:47:57,341
A monstrous creature.
It is a terrible crime to slay a unicorn.

911
01:47:57,549 --> 01:48:03,096
Drinking its blood will keep you alive
even if you are an inch from death.

912
01:48:03,305 --> 01:48:08,393
But at a terrible price. For you
have slain something so pure...

913
01:48:08,602 --> 01:48:13,482
...that the moment the blood touches
your lips, you will have a half-life.

914
01:48:13,648 --> 01:48:15,525
A cursed life.

915
01:48:15,692 --> 01:48:19,613
- Who would choose such a life?
- Can you think of no one?

916
01:48:19,821 --> 01:48:24,785
Do you mean to say that
that thing that killed the unicorn...

917
01:48:25,118 --> 01:48:29,081
...that was drinking its blood,
that was Voldemort?

918
01:48:29,289 --> 01:48:34,419
Do you know what is hidden
in the school at this very moment?

919
01:48:35,295 --> 01:48:36,755
The Philosopher's Stone.

920
01:48:38,131 --> 01:48:40,092
Harry!

921
01:48:40,675 --> 01:48:45,180
Hello there, Firenze.
See you've met our young Mr. Potter.

922
01:48:45,389 --> 01:48:47,516
You all right there, Harry?

923
01:48:48,725 --> 01:48:52,979
Harry Potter,
this is where I leave you.

924
01:48:53,897 --> 01:48:57,734
You're safe now. Good luck.

925
01:49:05,200 --> 01:49:09,454
You mean, You-Know-Who is out there
right now in the Forest?

926
01:49:09,663 --> 01:49:12,499
But he's weak.
He's living off the unicorns.

927
01:49:12,666 --> 01:49:15,627
Don't you see? We had it wrong.

928
01:49:15,836 --> 01:49:20,173
Snape doesn't want the Stone for himself.
He wants it for Voldemort.

929
01:49:20,382 --> 01:49:24,928
With the Elixir of Life,
Voldemort will be strong again.

930
01:49:25,178 --> 01:49:26,721
He'll come back.

931
01:49:26,888 --> 01:49:28,682
But if he comes back...

932
01:49:28,890 --> 01:49:32,894
...you don't think he'll try
to kill you, do you?

933
01:49:33,895 --> 01:49:37,440
If he'd had the chance,
he might have tried tonight.

934
01:49:37,691 --> 01:49:41,278
And to think I've been worrying
about my Potions final.

935
01:49:41,444 --> 01:49:45,031
Hang on a minute.
We're forgetting one thing.

936
01:49:45,407 --> 01:49:50,245
Who's the one wizard
Voldemort always feared?

937
01:49:51,037 --> 01:49:56,167
Dumbledore. As long as Dumbledore
is around, Harry, you're safe.

938
01:49:56,376 --> 01:50:00,422
As long as Dumbledore is around,
you can't be touched.

939
01:50:06,177 --> 01:50:11,600
I'd heard Hogwarts' final exams were
frightful, but I found that enjoyable.

940
01:50:11,808 --> 01:50:15,520
Speak for yourself.
All right there, Harry?

941
01:50:15,729 --> 01:50:20,859
- My scar. It keeps burning.
- It's happened before.

942
01:50:21,067 --> 01:50:23,778
- Not like this.
- You should see the nurse.

943
01:50:23,987 --> 01:50:27,407
I think it's a warning.
It means danger's coming.

944
01:50:35,081 --> 01:50:37,542
- Of course!
- What is it?

945
01:50:37,751 --> 01:50:41,546
Isn't it odd that what Hagrid wants
more than anything is a dragon...

946
01:50:41,713 --> 01:50:44,799
...and a stranger just happens
to have one?

947
01:50:44,966 --> 01:50:47,719
How many people wander around
with dragon eggs?

948
01:50:47,886 --> 01:50:50,180
Why didn't I see it before?

949
01:50:55,727 --> 01:50:59,230
Who gave you the egg?
What did he look like?

950
01:50:59,439 --> 01:51:02,233
I never saw his face.
He kept his hood up.

951
01:51:02,400 --> 01:51:04,944
You and this stranger
must have talked.

952
01:51:05,570 --> 01:51:09,199
He wanted to know what sort
of creatures I looked after.

953
01:51:09,366 --> 01:51:13,370
I said, "After Fluffy,
a dragon's gonna be no problem."

954
01:51:13,536 --> 01:51:17,999
- Was he interested in Fluffy?
- Of course he was interested.

955
01:51:18,416 --> 01:51:22,587
How often do you come across
a three-headed dog?

956
01:51:22,754 --> 01:51:28,426
But I told him, "The trick with any beast
is to know how to calm him."

957
01:51:28,635 --> 01:51:34,099
Take Fluffy, for example. Play him
music and he falls straight to sleep.

958
01:51:35,767 --> 01:51:38,478
I shouldn't have told you that.

959
01:51:38,645 --> 01:51:40,897
Where are you going?

960
01:51:47,862 --> 01:51:50,615
We have to see Dumbledore.
Immediately!

961
01:51:51,032 --> 01:51:53,701
I'm afraid he's not here.

962
01:51:53,910 --> 01:51:58,164
He received an urgent owl
from the Ministry of Magic and left.

963
01:51:58,623 --> 01:52:01,626
He's gone?
But this is important!

964
01:52:01,793 --> 01:52:05,296
This is about the Philosopher's Stone!

965
01:52:05,505 --> 01:52:09,300
- How do you know--?
- Someone's going to try and steal it.

966
01:52:09,884 --> 01:52:15,098
I don't know how you know,
but I assure you it is well protected.

967
01:52:15,306 --> 01:52:19,644
Now would you go back
to your dormitories? Quietly.

968
01:52:27,902 --> 01:52:30,738
That was no stranger Hagrid met.
It was Snape.

969
01:52:30,905 --> 01:52:33,533
Which means he knows
how to get past Fluffy.

970
01:52:33,741 --> 01:52:37,662
- And with Dumbledore gone--
- Good afternoon.

971
01:52:39,664 --> 01:52:43,042
What would three young Gryffindors...

972
01:52:43,168 --> 01:52:47,964
...be doing inside on a day like this?

973
01:52:52,135 --> 01:52:55,638
- We were just--
- You ought to be careful.

974
01:52:56,181 --> 01:52:58,183
People will think you're...

975
01:53:02,478 --> 01:53:05,148
...up to something.

976
01:53:15,491 --> 01:53:17,452
Now what do we do?

977
01:53:17,660 --> 01:53:21,456
We go down the trap door. Tonight.

978
01:53:35,178 --> 01:53:36,679
Trevor.

979
01:53:36,971 --> 01:53:40,391
Trevor, go! You shouldn't be here!

980
01:53:40,642 --> 01:53:46,105
Neither should you.
You're sneaking out again, aren't you?

981
01:53:46,272 --> 01:53:50,234
- Neville, listen. We were--
- No, I won't let you!

982
01:53:50,526 --> 01:53:55,073
You'll get Gryffindor into trouble again.
I'll fight you.

983
01:53:55,281 --> 01:54:00,828
Neville, I'm really sorry about this.
Petrificus Totalus.

984
01:54:07,543 --> 01:54:11,381
You're a little scary sometimes,
you know that?

985
01:54:11,589 --> 01:54:15,218
Brilliant, but scary.

986
01:54:15,843 --> 01:54:17,970
Let's go.

987
01:54:18,137 --> 01:54:22,392
- Sorry.
- It's for your own good, you know.

988
01:54:27,814 --> 01:54:31,776
- You stood on my foot!
- Sorry.

989
01:54:35,613 --> 01:54:37,657
Alohomora.

990
01:54:49,710 --> 01:54:52,213
Wait a minute. He's...

991
01:54:53,506 --> 01:54:55,258
...snoring.

992
01:54:58,177 --> 01:55:03,683
Snape's already been here.
He's put a spell on the harp.

993
01:55:05,309 --> 01:55:08,312
It's got horrible breath.

994
01:55:10,857 --> 01:55:12,942
- We have to move its paw.
- What?

995
01:55:13,151 --> 01:55:14,610
Come on!

996
01:55:18,656 --> 01:55:20,741
Okay. Push.

997
01:55:43,890 --> 01:55:47,518
I'll go first. Don't follow
until I give you a sign.

998
01:55:47,685 --> 01:55:52,732
If something bad happens,
get yourselves out.

999
01:55:53,524 --> 01:55:56,986
Does it seem a bit quiet to you?

1000
01:55:57,695 --> 01:55:59,530
The harp.

1001
01:56:00,198 --> 01:56:02,909
It's stopped playing.

1002
01:56:13,211 --> 01:56:14,962
Jump!

1003
01:56:28,267 --> 01:56:31,896
Lucky this plant thing's here, really.

1004
01:56:46,327 --> 01:56:49,455
Stop moving, both of you.
This is Devil's Snare.

1005
01:56:49,622 --> 01:56:53,376
You have to relax. If you don't,
it will only kill you faster.

1006
01:56:53,542 --> 01:56:58,506
Kill us faster?
Oh, now I can relax!

1007
01:57:00,800 --> 01:57:02,134
Hermione!

1008
01:57:02,677 --> 01:57:06,514
- Now what are we gonna do?
- Just relax!

1009
01:57:06,722 --> 01:57:11,185
- Hermione, where are you?
- Do what I say! Trust me.

1010
01:57:18,317 --> 01:57:21,654
- Are you okay?
- Yeah, I'm fine.

1011
01:57:21,862 --> 01:57:24,907
- He's not relaxing, is he?
- Apparently not.

1012
01:57:25,116 --> 01:57:27,618
- We've gotta do something.
- What?

1013
01:57:27,827 --> 01:57:30,788
I remember reading something
in Herbology.

1014
01:57:31,622 --> 01:57:35,501
Devil's Snare, Devil's Snare.
It's deadly fun...

1015
01:57:35,710 --> 01:57:40,089
...but will sulk in the sun!
That's it! It hates sunlight.

1016
01:57:40,339 --> 01:57:42,383
Lumus Solem.

1017
01:57:50,433 --> 01:57:53,060
- Ron, you okay?
- Yeah.

1018
01:57:55,730 --> 01:57:58,232
Lucky we didn't panic.

1019
01:57:58,983 --> 01:58:02,486
Lucky Hermione pays attention
in Herbology.

1020
01:58:04,113 --> 01:58:05,614
What is that?

1021
01:58:05,823 --> 01:58:09,618
I don't know. Sounds like wings.

1022
01:58:22,673 --> 01:58:26,135
Curious. I've never seen
birds like these.

1023
01:58:26,343 --> 01:58:29,972
They're not birds.
They're keys.

1024
01:58:30,181 --> 01:58:33,642
And I'll bet one of them
fits that door.

1025
01:58:37,146 --> 01:58:41,734
- What's this all about?
- I don't know.

1026
01:58:47,615 --> 01:58:49,658
Strange.

1027
01:58:50,034 --> 01:58:52,369
Alohomora!

1028
01:58:55,289 --> 01:58:57,625
Well, it was worth a try.

1029
01:58:57,833 --> 01:59:01,045
What will we do?
There must be a thousand keys.

1030
01:59:01,253 --> 01:59:05,174
We want a big, old-fashioned one.
Probably rusty.

1031
01:59:05,382 --> 01:59:08,761
I see it!
The one with the broken wing.

1032
01:59:12,389 --> 01:59:14,725
What's wrong?

1033
01:59:15,601 --> 01:59:17,061
It's too simple.

1034
01:59:17,269 --> 01:59:22,107
Go on! If Snape could catch it
on that old broomstick, you can.

1035
01:59:22,274 --> 01:59:25,819
You're the youngest Seeker
in a century.

1036
01:59:42,670 --> 01:59:45,673
This complicates things a bit.

1037
02:00:06,944 --> 02:00:09,154
Catch the key!

1038
02:00:13,242 --> 02:00:15,202
Hurry up!

1039
02:00:47,651 --> 02:00:52,406
I don't like this.
I don't like this at all.

1040
02:00:52,614 --> 02:00:55,743
Where are we? A graveyard.

1041
02:00:56,118 --> 02:00:58,746
This is no graveyard.

1042
02:01:06,253 --> 02:01:09,173
It's a chessboard.

1043
02:01:21,143 --> 02:01:23,061
There's the door.

1044
02:01:35,157 --> 02:01:36,617
Now what do we do?

1045
02:01:36,950 --> 02:01:41,121
It's obvious, isn't it? We've got
to play our way across the room.

1046
02:01:41,705 --> 02:01:45,459
Harry, you take
the empty bishop's square.

1047
02:01:45,834 --> 02:01:50,005
Hermione, you'll be
the queen-side castle.

1048
02:01:50,214 --> 02:01:54,301
As for me, I'll be a knight.

1049
02:02:01,475 --> 02:02:03,185
What happens now?

1050
02:02:03,936 --> 02:02:06,980
Well, white moves first.

1051
02:02:07,189 --> 02:02:09,024
And then...

1052
02:02:10,817 --> 02:02:12,069
...we play.

1053
02:02:22,621 --> 02:02:27,709
Ron, you don't suppose
this is going to be like...

1054
02:02:27,918 --> 02:02:31,505
...real wizard's chess, do you?

1055
02:02:31,880 --> 02:02:34,841
You there, D-5.

1056
02:02:49,439 --> 02:02:50,983
Yes, Hermione.

1057
02:02:51,233 --> 02:02:56,280
I think this is gonna be
exactly like wizard's chess.

1058
02:03:02,202 --> 02:03:04,746
Castle to E-4!

1059
02:03:08,375 --> 02:03:10,377
Pawn to C-3!

1060
02:03:55,297 --> 02:03:59,301
- Wait a minute.
- You understand right, Harry.

1061
02:03:59,509 --> 02:04:04,264
Once I make my move,
the queen will take me.

1062
02:04:04,848 --> 02:04:07,267
Then you're free to check the king.

1063
02:04:07,434 --> 02:04:10,061
- No. Ron, no!
- What is it?

1064
02:04:10,771 --> 02:04:15,442
- He's going to sacrifice himself.
- No, there must be another way!

1065
02:04:15,650 --> 02:04:19,362
Do you wanna stop Snape
from getting that Stone or not?

1066
02:04:19,571 --> 02:04:23,200
Harry, it's you that has to go on.
I know it.

1067
02:04:23,658 --> 02:04:26,453
Not me. Not Hermione. You.

1068
02:04:36,713 --> 02:04:39,633
Knight to H-3.

1069
02:05:00,529 --> 02:05:02,531
Check.

1070
02:05:31,685 --> 02:05:33,520
Ron!

1071
02:05:33,687 --> 02:05:39,526
No, don't move!
Don't forget, we're still playing.

1072
02:05:54,541 --> 02:05:55,875
Checkmate.

1073
02:06:15,812 --> 02:06:18,273
Take care of Ron.
Then go to the owlery.

1074
02:06:18,481 --> 02:06:22,360
Send a message to Dumbledore.
Ron's right.

1075
02:06:22,569 --> 02:06:24,446
I have to go on.

1076
02:06:24,988 --> 02:06:30,910
You'll be okay, Harry.
You're a great wizard. You really are.

1077
02:06:31,077 --> 02:06:33,621
Not as good as you.

1078
02:06:34,456 --> 02:06:39,252
Me? Books and cleverness.
There are more important things.

1079
02:06:40,462 --> 02:06:46,134
Friendship and bravery.
And, Harry, just be careful.

1080
02:07:24,214 --> 02:07:25,882
You?

1081
02:07:26,674 --> 02:07:30,470
No, it can't be.
Snape, he was the--

1082
02:07:30,678 --> 02:07:33,765
Yes, he does seem the type,
doesn't he?

1083
02:07:33,973 --> 02:07:37,101
Next to him, who would suspect...

1084
02:07:37,310 --> 02:07:41,231
...poor, stuttering
Professor Quirrell?

1085
02:07:41,439 --> 02:07:46,820
But that day, during the Quidditch match,
Snape tried to kill me.

1086
02:07:46,986 --> 02:07:49,823
No, dear boy. I tried to kill you!

1087
02:07:50,323 --> 02:07:54,452
If Snape's cloak hadn't caught
fire and broken my eye contact...

1088
02:07:54,661 --> 02:07:56,913
...I would have succeeded.

1089
02:07:57,121 --> 02:08:00,124
Even with Snape muttering
his counter-curse.

1090
02:08:00,333 --> 02:08:02,502
Snape was trying to save me?

1091
02:08:02,710 --> 02:08:08,091
I knew you were a danger to me,
especially after Halloween.

1092
02:08:08,299 --> 02:08:12,554
- Then you let the troll in!
- Very good, Potter, yes.

1093
02:08:12,762 --> 02:08:15,765
Snape, unfortunately, wasn't fooled.

1094
02:08:16,349 --> 02:08:21,271
While everyone ran about,
he went to the third floor to head me off.

1095
02:08:22,230 --> 02:08:25,733
He, of course, never trusted me again.

1096
02:08:26,693 --> 02:08:31,990
He rarely left me alone.
But he doesn't understand.

1097
02:08:32,198 --> 02:08:36,244
I'm never alone. Never.

1098
02:08:36,452 --> 02:08:40,540
Now, what does this mirror do?

1099
02:08:42,083 --> 02:08:44,210
I see what I desire.

1100
02:08:44,794 --> 02:08:49,215
I see myself holding the Stone.
But how do I get it?

1101
02:08:49,382 --> 02:08:51,509
Use the boy.

1102
02:08:52,385 --> 02:08:56,306
Come here, Potter! Now!

1103
02:09:08,359 --> 02:09:12,322
Tell me, what do you see?

1104
02:09:37,555 --> 02:09:39,974
What is it? What do you see?

1105
02:09:40,183 --> 02:09:45,355
I'm shaking hands with Dumbledore.
I've won the house cup.

1106
02:09:45,563 --> 02:09:47,106
He lies.

1107
02:09:47,607 --> 02:09:51,277
Tell the truth! What do you see?

1108
02:09:51,486 --> 02:09:55,907
- Let me speak to him.
- Master, you are not strong enough.

1109
02:09:56,115 --> 02:10:00,161
I have strength enough for this.

1110
02:10:18,346 --> 02:10:21,182
Harry Potter...

1111
02:10:21,390 --> 02:10:23,768
...we meet again.

1112
02:10:23,976 --> 02:10:25,394
Voldemort.

1113
02:10:25,603 --> 02:10:29,524
Yes. You see what I've become?

1114
02:10:29,816 --> 02:10:33,402
See what I must do to survive?

1115
02:10:33,611 --> 02:10:37,740
Live off another. A mere parasite.

1116
02:10:38,407 --> 02:10:41,744
Unicorn blood can sustain me...

1117
02:10:41,953 --> 02:10:45,623
...but it cannot give me
a body of my own.

1118
02:10:45,790 --> 02:10:49,377
But there is something that can.

1119
02:10:49,585 --> 02:10:55,258
Something that, conveniently enough,
lies in your pocket.

1120
02:10:55,508 --> 02:10:57,176
Stop him!

1121
02:11:02,181 --> 02:11:04,934
Don't be a fool.

1122
02:11:05,434 --> 02:11:08,604
Why suffer an horrific death...

1123
02:11:08,813 --> 02:11:12,441
...when you can join me and live?

1124
02:11:12,650 --> 02:11:13,734
Never!

1125
02:11:15,736 --> 02:11:20,491
Bravery. Your parents had it too.

1126
02:11:21,284 --> 02:11:24,579
Tell me, Harry...

1127
02:11:24,787 --> 02:11:28,708
...would you like to see
your mother and father again?

1128
02:11:28,916 --> 02:11:30,960
Together...

1129
02:11:31,168 --> 02:11:33,796
...we can bring them back.

1130
02:11:34,171 --> 02:11:38,843
All I ask is for something in return.

1131
02:11:45,641 --> 02:11:48,686
That's it, Harry.

1132
02:11:49,645 --> 02:11:53,524
There is no good and evil.

1133
02:11:53,733 --> 02:11:56,736
There is only power...

1134
02:11:56,944 --> 02:12:01,032
...and those too weak to seek it.

1135
02:12:01,741 --> 02:12:06,746
Together, we'll do
extraordinary things.

1136
02:12:07,204 --> 02:12:09,457
Just give me the Stone!

1137
02:12:12,043 --> 02:12:13,252
You liar!

1138
02:12:13,461 --> 02:12:15,588
Kill him!

1139
02:12:39,111 --> 02:12:44,450
- What is this magic?
- Fool, get the Stone!

1140
02:14:29,680 --> 02:14:32,224
Good afternoon, Harry.

1141
02:14:34,351 --> 02:14:38,772
- Tokens from your admirers?
- Admirers?

1142
02:14:39,023 --> 02:14:45,029
What happened in the dungeons between
you and Professor Quirrell is a secret.

1143
02:14:45,237 --> 02:14:50,034
So, naturally, the whole school knows.

1144
02:14:52,369 --> 02:14:56,040
I see that your friend Ronald
has saved you the trouble...

1145
02:14:56,248 --> 02:14:59,084
...of opening your Chocolate Frogs.

1146
02:14:59,293 --> 02:15:02,296
Ron was here? Is he all right?
What about Hermione?

1147
02:15:02,504 --> 02:15:07,343
Fine. They're both just fine.

1148
02:15:07,926 --> 02:15:10,763
- What happened to the Stone?
- Relax, dear boy.

1149
02:15:11,055 --> 02:15:14,183
The Stone has been destroyed.

1150
02:15:14,391 --> 02:15:18,354
My friend Nicholas and I
have had a little chat...

1151
02:15:18,562 --> 02:15:22,566
...and agreed it was best all around.

1152
02:15:22,775 --> 02:15:26,570
But then, Flamel,
he'll die, won't he?

1153
02:15:28,656 --> 02:15:34,119
He has enough Elixir
to set his affairs in order.

1154
02:15:34,328 --> 02:15:37,581
But yes, he will die.

1155
02:15:37,790 --> 02:15:40,209
How is it I got the Stone, sir?

1156
02:15:40,417 --> 02:15:43,003
One minute I was staring
in the mirror and--

1157
02:15:43,212 --> 02:15:47,299
You see, only a person...

1158
02:15:47,549 --> 02:15:51,512
...who wanted to find the Stone,
find it...

1159
02:15:51,720 --> 02:15:56,308
...but not use it,
would be able to get it.

1160
02:15:57,267 --> 02:16:00,771
That is one of my more brilliant ideas.

1161
02:16:00,979 --> 02:16:06,026
And between you and me,
that is saying something.

1162
02:16:07,444 --> 02:16:12,699
Does that mean, with the Stone gone,
that Voldemort can never come back?

1163
02:16:12,908 --> 02:16:15,244
I'm afraid...

1164
02:16:16,620 --> 02:16:20,707
...there are ways
in which he can return.

1165
02:16:21,417 --> 02:16:23,961
Harry, do you know why...

1166
02:16:24,169 --> 02:16:28,173
...Professor Quirrell couldn't bear
to have you touch him?

1167
02:16:28,382 --> 02:16:33,053
It was because of your mother.
She sacrificed herself for you.

1168
02:16:33,554 --> 02:16:36,807
And that kind of act leaves a mark.

1169
02:16:37,015 --> 02:16:40,769
No, this kind of mark cannot be seen.

1170
02:16:40,978 --> 02:16:45,899
- It lives in your very skin.
- What is it?

1171
02:16:46,775 --> 02:16:50,445
Love, Harry. Love.

1172
02:16:58,495 --> 02:17:02,708
Bertie Bott's Every Flavor Beans.

1173
02:17:02,916 --> 02:17:07,588
I was most unfortunate in my youth
to come across a vomit-flavored one.

1174
02:17:07,796 --> 02:17:11,133
And since then,
I've lost my liking for them.

1175
02:17:11,341 --> 02:17:14,720
But I think I could be safe...

1176
02:17:14,928 --> 02:17:17,264
...with a nice toffee.

1177
02:17:21,351 --> 02:17:22,936
Alas!

1178
02:17:23,604 --> 02:17:25,689
Earwax.

1179
02:17:40,996 --> 02:17:44,166
- All right there, Ron?
- All right. You?

1180
02:17:45,292 --> 02:17:47,961
All right. Hermione?

1181
02:17:48,670 --> 02:17:50,505
Never better.

1182
02:18:06,271 --> 02:18:08,774
Another year gone.

1183
02:18:09,524 --> 02:18:14,071
And now, as I understand it,
the house cup needs awarding.

1184
02:18:14,279 --> 02:18:16,907
And the points stand thus:

1185
02:18:17,115 --> 02:18:22,871
In fourth place,
Gryffindor with 312 points.

1186
02:18:24,873 --> 02:18:30,504
Third place,
Hufflepuff with 352 points.

1187
02:18:35,759 --> 02:18:37,594
In second place...

1188
02:18:37,803 --> 02:18:42,599
...Ravenclaw with 426 points.

1189
02:18:48,313 --> 02:18:49,981
And in first place...

1190
02:18:50,357 --> 02:18:55,737
...with 472 points, Slytherin house.

1191
02:19:01,368 --> 02:19:03,537
Nice one, mate.

1192
02:19:07,416 --> 02:19:11,461
Yes, well done, Slytherin.
Well done.

1193
02:19:11,753 --> 02:19:16,049
However, recent events must
be taken into account.

1194
02:19:16,258 --> 02:19:21,221
And I have a few last-minute points
to award.

1195
02:19:21,847 --> 02:19:27,310
To Miss Hermione Granger,
for the cool use of intellect...

1196
02:19:27,519 --> 02:19:30,355
...while others were in grave peril...

1197
02:19:31,064 --> 02:19:33,275
...50 points.

1198
02:19:34,234 --> 02:19:35,527
Good job.

1199
02:19:43,201 --> 02:19:49,249
Second, to Mr. Ronald Weasley,
for the best-played game of chess...

1200
02:19:49,791 --> 02:19:55,046
...that Hogwarts has seen
these many years, 50 points.

1201
02:19:59,634 --> 02:20:01,678
And third...

1202
02:20:02,262 --> 02:20:05,098
...to Mr. Harry Potter...

1203
02:20:05,307 --> 02:20:09,644
...for pure nerve
and outstanding courage...

1204
02:20:10,187 --> 02:20:15,108
...I award Gryffindor house 60 points.

1205
02:20:23,408 --> 02:20:25,327
We're tied with Slytherin!

1206
02:20:25,493 --> 02:20:31,541
Finally, it takes a great deal of bravery
to stand up to your enemies...

1207
02:20:31,750 --> 02:20:35,629
...but a great deal more
to stand up to your friends.

1208
02:20:35,837 --> 02:20:38,798
I award 10 points...

1209
02:20:39,007 --> 02:20:42,177
...to Neville Longbottom.

1210
02:20:55,523 --> 02:20:58,985
Assuming that my calculations
are correct...

1211
02:20:59,194 --> 02:21:03,698
...I believe that a change
of decoration is in order.

1212
02:21:08,705 --> 02:21:12,080
Gryffindor wins the house cup.

1213
02:21:50,205 --> 02:21:53,540
Come on, now.
Hurry up, you'll be late.

1214
02:21:53,750 --> 02:21:57,960
Train's leaving. Go on.
Come on, hurry up.

1215
02:22:03,425 --> 02:22:06,720
- Come on, Harry.
- One minute.

1216
02:22:13,015 --> 02:22:16,730
Thought you were leaving
without saying goodbye, did you?

1217
02:22:20,110 --> 02:22:21,775
This is for you.

1218
02:22:38,545 --> 02:22:40,630
Thanks, Hagrid.

1219
02:22:46,550 --> 02:22:50,970
Go on. On with you. On with you now.
Oh, listen, Harry.

1220
02:22:51,345 --> 02:22:55,810
If that dolt of a cousin of yours,
Dudley, gives you any grief...

1221
02:22:56,020 --> 02:22:58,770
...you could always threaten him...

1222
02:22:58,980 --> 02:23:01,860
...with a nice pair of ears
to go with his tail.

1223
02:23:02,065 --> 02:23:07,115
But we're not allowed to do magic
away from Hogwarts. You know that.

1224
02:23:07,530 --> 02:23:11,910
I do. But your cousin don't, do he?

1225
02:23:17,455 --> 02:23:20,585
Feels strange to be going home,
doesn't it?

1226
02:23:20,795 --> 02:23:22,880
I'm not going home.

1227
02:23:23,085 --> 02:23:24,965
Not really.
